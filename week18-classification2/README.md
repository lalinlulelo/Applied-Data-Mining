# SCC.413 Applied Data Mining
## Week 18 - Classification (part 2)

This week we continue with classification using scikit-learn, but now incorporate the document model you have created previously for extracting features. We also introduce feature unions, classifying single texts (tweets), error analysis, and sentiment analysis (the assessed exercise).


To open Jupyter notebooks, simply open a terminal in the `week18-classification2` folder and run

``$ jupyter notebook``

A web browser should start, and you'll be able to select the relevant notebook from the individual lab folders.

There are three parts to this week's lab exercises. You should complete them in the following order, as each leads from the previous.


1. Classification 2 (using custom document) ([jupyter notebook](413-wk18-classification2.ipynb))
    - Performing classification (as in week 17), but instead using a Document object to hold processed features.
    - Feature unions
    - Non-assessed exercise
2. Authorship attribution ([jupyter notebook](413-wk18-authorship.ipynb))
    - Classifying single tweets, in this case to predict the author of the tweet.
    - Error analysis
    - Non-assessed exercise
3. Sentiment analysis ([jupyter notebook](413-wk18-sentiment.ipynb))
    - **Assessed exercise**, utilising what you have learnt to build a sentiment classifier.
    - Due to be marked by week 20 lab.
