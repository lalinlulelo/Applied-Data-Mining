Ohio has defined marriage as one man and one woman, if SCOTUS now writes law, guess Ohio has no law and you may marry who/what you wish.
@StoneColdChik the panthers are advocating the killing of police, SCOTUS says that "true threats are outside the 1st Amendment so why aren't
How does Sarah Palin stay so tan when she lives in a state that does not see sun 50% of the year?
@realDonaldTrump  Disappointed on your comment on SCOTUS using the 14th amend to void MILLIONS of legal votes by state citizens. Sad USA
I told someone about how I once sat on the floor of my hotel room and watched Seinfeld for hours and they threatened to punch me.
The SCOTUS claimed under the 14th amendment they could make the same sex marriage ruling. No matter how far you stretch it isn't there.
6th circuit &amp; SCOTUS denied #KimDavis appeals &amp; upheld Bunnings order, what the heck makes her crappy lawyer think they'll do something now?
Sarah Palin says immigrants to the US should 'speak American'.  Just think: she could have been the Vice President  http://t.co/IB1P4umes0
Suggestion - get familiar with 1ST Amendment.  it pretty much strikes down all SCOTUS rulings regarding gay marriage, holiday celebrations
What's with this Twitter account? It's like the Seinfeld episode where they talk about themselves in the 3rd person. https://t.co/jlQIzMGtZR
@CNN - When you waste Sunday pretending Sarah Palin or her opinions are relevant you just admit that you've given up on being a news source.

@Lrihendry @ChristieC733 what's scary is that it was only 5-4. Like our SCOTUS, Irving may flip on one vote.
I think Sarah Palin may have a health issue . I had a hyper - active thyroid and I still can't remember all of the odd things I said &amp; did.
Maybe this judge is on to something..unintended consequences to make SCOTUS listen https://t.co/MnJAX4eKpO
Snoop Dogg cancelled his performance at the fair tomorrow... Turns out he had a prior commitment for Mitch-a-Palooza.
Pls CNN why in a world u bring this idiot Sarah Palin on Sunday great news program state of the Union CNN u really fuck up my Sunday
No Snoop Dogg tomorrow,  out with illness. I was really looking forward to Snoop after classes tomorrow. It's how this day just went today..
It absolutely bothers the Liberals that SCOTUS ruled the 1st amendment applies to campaign cash as founder's intended! @cspanwj #PJNET #P2

Sarah Palin says US immigrants should 'speak American' http://t.co/mQQ4Vk6CVs &lt; Errrr she means English right?
#KimDavis appealed Bunnings original order and both the 6th circuit and SCOTUS denied the appeals   Why does she think it'll change now?
Young Buck may face five years in prison due to smoking marijuana with Snoop Dogg http://t.co/CYG7x2hKYG
@Petapup1 @S3nt13ntB31ng @SaculSacul won't  be the 1st time SCOTUS violated the Constitution &amp; won't be the last.
Sarah Palin says US immigrants should speak "american", does she mean Navajo or Sioux? http://t.co/SLfVeoMb6C
SCOTUS cannot make law only rule on it. Get real America.  Unless it's healthcare.Then they feel they can.    https://t.co/IyMH2Hbe09
@tedcruz our 14th amendment is also under attack, which one do we chose? oh yeah it's up to SCOTUS and they ruled!
Today, Republicans will talk about how much they appreciate workers.  Tomorrow they'll work to crush worker rights. #LaborDay sarah palin

@Yowan @EyeAmSMF  However, I don't think today's SCOTUS and Fed Govt would interpret the 9th that way.  9th &amp;10th have seemingly disappeared
@MJosephSheppard Never said that the Dems weren't mistake-prone. Sarah Palin is just PATIENT ZERO for THE STUPID. In her defense GBW was 1st
Watching Sarah Palin telling people to speak "American" was the highlight of my Sunday. That was some classic self destruction.
May or may not have twisted my ankle reenacting Serena vs. Venus with my roommate last night.
@PoliticalLaughs @kesgardner Besides I don't believe that SCOTUS has the power to overturn state marriage laws per the 10th amendment
@daxgyetmhanaak people wholeheartedly believing satire about Sarah Palin is what got her the reputation she has in the 1st place.
@israel4911 @Letha_Hughes It was the 14th that SCOTUS ruled was being violated in blocking marriage equality. News not your strong subject.
@CNNSotu @SarahPalinUSA  Sarah Palin may be a stupid cow  -- but she is our stupid cow. We love her
Fantastic! Sarah Palin demands that migrants to USA 'speak American'. Can't make this stuff up. http://t.co/rxPfEubTiW

My gods, Sarah Palin is genuinely crazy, isn't she...    http://t.co/19YKe4lzTr
SCOTUS Apparently is Saying That Gays Have an Equal Right to Marriage Under the 14th Amendment.
Tina Fey may look like Sarah Palin but she sure as hell has a lot more going on in the brain region #Bossypants http://t.co/tPIb50u0UQ
@jspoupart @JoeC1776 no. Congress makes laws and the SCOTUS settles disputes. In this case, the 1st Amendment lost.
How is sarah Palin still in politics. She was and still is the embarrassment of the Gop, but she may be out done by some douche &amp; his toupee
@LarryOConnor @GretchenCarlson U sound like the hated "smartset" now? Is #KimDavis the 1st to ignore unlawful ruling from SCOTUS in history?
@EE  claims they can't do anything but upgrade at my own cost. 1st month with them - should have stayed with T-Mobile contract. #AvoidEE

Guy at T-mobile: ok so just call the store tomorrow and ask for me so we can set up the phone!  Me the next day: what the fuck was his name.

Theresa May, in her desire to win over the dunderheads who vote in Tory leadership elections, really does personify the Stupid Party.
@neon_shadows I said nothing of the sort. I support the 2nd amendment. Trump wants to ban assault weapons. I don't.

This is the last agonizing Sunday of the year. No more of these until Valentine's Day.

@steve_hanke Tsipras is currently on holidays and on the 6th he is going to Egypt. So i dont think he realizes the situation we are in

@BritainFirst It's like Tsipras says, they're in the middle of a humanitarian crisis. BF should have their march cancelled, and the money
@ruraljules If it makes you feeling any better....I got dumped by my 1st boyfriend, by note, right before Valentine's Day. :\

Deplorable and wrong-headed comments by Bristol's only UKIP councillor. I hope he loses his seat in May and UKIP fold http://t.co/l4k1GggRlm

@paulwaugh to be fair Paul, after SNP, UKIP, Boundary changes &amp; 50 fewer MPs, it may not be leader that's influencing the 80% who disagree
It would be a strategic mistake of the 1st order 4 Tsipras (let alone a genuine anti-austerity politician) to seek and maintain a leading ..
Keep in mind Tsipras' 1st state visit after elections was Pope Francis in the Vatican. @ma000111 Tsipras an atheist representing Orthodoxy.

Just sitting here staring at my Xbox waiting for the #Destiny update to finish downloading. 30 + minutes. I may die waiting...

@XboxSupport abt time we got a reply from xbox 4 hours and counting, this is the 3rd time in a month what u doing to fix this issue xbox
What will the Destiny 2.0 patch be at when I get home? 70% 48%? 95%? 2%? Who knows. My Xbox may just be on fire the way things were going.

My AD/DA interface drivers just went BOOM!  It seems Microsoft is forcing me to upgrade to Windows 10. I may gone some time...
@OccupyBears he fancied rolling the ball to Zlatan on the edge of the box early on and then he totally fucked up for PSG's 1st goal...
@ACMilanNorway anyway, telling Zlatan he'll be the center of the team is like telling the sun it's the center of the solar system. No crap.
This may be our last chance to see Zlatan in the World Cup and FIFA totally fucked it up. Shocker.
Watching a replay of the PSG / Lille match from Friday. No Zlatan makes PSG unwatchable.
So, about Zlatan... I don't want him. All reports are that he's not a good teammate. He'd be our 3rd DP Fwd, how do you work the 3 together?
If GMB goes after Boko Haram with the same passion he went after Dasuki,the 50+ victims of the Yobe bomb blast on Friday will still be alive

Not a great start for the amateur Paul Dunne. Imagine having to compose yourself to hit your third ball (5th shot) off the tee on hole 2!
Then you add in the guilt factor. Did Harper Lee really want Watchman published? If her 1st draft has been hijacked I'd feel bad reading it.
@KellyTilghmanGC   After the 2nd round, you did your usual melodramatic spew that Dustin Johnson was in a class of his own. Same old garbage.

R&amp;A's handling of the end of round 2 was diabolical. I watched Spieth, Matsuyama and Dustin Johnson early Saturday, very unfair on them.
@bieberscinema @SpikeLSB Who's Deion? That may be worse than the Paul McCartney thing
Just gonna say it: The lyrics in "Bad Blood" sound like they were written by a 7th grader. "Done" doesn't have two syllables, Taylor.
Still can't believe Ryan Braun and Jew Unit were able to beat the 1st test on technicality that his piss was mishandled!
Boko Haram are so evil. Even on this sacred day for all muslims, they are carrying out bombings. May the hottest part in hell be for them
Floyd Mayweather should  buy 1st row for all who beat the hell out of Berto, Berto should buy 1st row for the judge who sent Floyd to jail.

I wish Mani Shankar Aiyar commit suicide tonight to meet Yakub tomorrow in hell
Would love to watch the live screening of Yakub being hanged tomorrow... #YakubVerdict
Why Yakub is so scared of death, when he is sure of getting 72 virgins tomorrow? Why Siculars are denying Allah's guaranteed reward? Sad.
Watched Paper Towns on Saturday and I'm still very disappointed with the movie
Pranab Mukherjee has just again rejected Yakub's 2nd mercy petition, hanging would be on as per schedule at 7am tomorrow #HangYakubNow .
Yakub may or may not hav deseved death but he definitely deservd life imprisonment 4his deeds.Shame on those who are painting him as a saint
All those who petitioned for stopping Yakub's hanging , may hang themselves ...This would be the best  "Shraddhanjali" to him
And even after all the petitions, all the hearings, someone will say tomorrow that Yakub didn't get a fair trial.
The Zoo miniseries may be the worst collection of images &amp; sounds man has ever produced. We're talking Sharknado w/o the self-awareness.

Yakub death may be unfortunate bt we shud respect SC's decision n not vitiate atmosphere in the name of religion #YakubToHang #YakubVerdict
@5Forty3 the way MSM and leftists are crying for Yakub, ppl may mistake him as some son-of-soil patriot sacrificing himself for nation
@brownbrumby Agree with 2nd part,but Yakub is no reason. Best logical argument against his hanging by @Raghav_Bahl. @YRDeshmukh @asadowaisi
Reason why Ant-Man may have 'struggled' vs. other Marvel? My parents assumed it was a parody.
@tajinderbagga No issues if he is saving an innocent of any religion, but Yakub killed hundreds of innocent, tomo Bhushan may back ISIS too!

"Yeah, we may pay our fighters 0.01% of what you make but they sure as fuck would beat your ass!" - UFC response to Floyd Mayweather
I'm not even a fan of box/mma but c'mon if you don't think Floyd Mayweather is a fucking joke then you're clueless
Carly Fiorina should probably learn what 'organ harvesting' actually is if she's going to use the term on the Sunday morning talk shows.
very bold of CNN to show the Hulk Hogan sex tape during the GOP debate tomorrow...at least we can see disappointing dicks on 2 channels now
Unlike Mel Gibson, Chuck Norris didn't get drunk &amp;quot;one night&amp;quot; and spout off remarks of anti-semitism; he does this every Thursday.
@POTUS  you bring all kids of MUSLIMS here to the USA but the Christians being slaughtered by Isis YOU leave to die!! MAY GOD FORGIVE YOU!!
Harper trying to kiss up to Muslims now, after all the anti-Islam rhetoric during C51. I may throw up in my mouth a little.

The ONLY line I will remember tomorrow is John Kasich's dad was a mailman..... Who the hell cares?!?!? @foxnews
I can't wait until August 23 so that I don't have to hear any more of the Zac Brown Band.

Ya know, John Kasich actually seems like a real human being with a real record.. Too bad that may or may not mean anything
John Kasich just acted like a human being.  This may be a huge mistake. #GOPDebate

Rangers LF Josh Hamilton was out again with a sore left knee, and he'll have an MRI on Friday.  #Rangers
David Price does not look happy getting sent off. He's allowed a hit each inning and left the game with the tying run at 2nd.
You'd assume the Mets would love to have David Wright back by next weekend in Colorado, worst case scenario Monday in Philadelphia.

Did anyone tell Dustin Johnson that winning requires a lead on the 4th day and not just the 1st day?

Wendy Williams sat there and literally made transphobic comments about Caitlyn Jenner and yet you don't see anything wrong??
@Chris__Shield @kizrees at least Dustin Johnson knows how to party which is why I'm guessing he falls apart by Sunday after his weekend out
The Weeknd is releasing on the 28th but I can't even be excited because Frank Ocean ruined the whole getting excited for an album thing.

@starbirdrebel it'll be a cold day in hell before you got me anywhere near that Sunday line up. I'd rather see the Foo Fighters.
So Caitlyn Jenner may face man slaughter charges. He thought that the sex change would be easier for when she goes to prison
Kanye West to replace Frank Ocean at FYF Fest this Saturday. If I had tickets, I'd be pissed and fuckin' AMPED at the same time.

Saying you came in 3rd on Big Brother is just saying you spent 3-4 months not working for no reason at all.
The 'Muslims Facing Tomorrow' organization is as big of a joke as the 'Muslim Canadian Congress' organization.
Rousey vs. Holm may be the biggest waste of a UFC card I've ever seen.
@nnamzzz @SBNLukeThomas I agree, unfair. I'd like to see the Rousey fight 1st too. I don't see fight happening without Cyborg thro backdoor
I hope Zayn isn't hanging out with May because she's been trying to start shit with his life for years.
why is the sun out???? where is frank ocean????? why do I have no plans for tonight?????????
So Caitlyn Jenner may face manslaughter charges.    The jokes just write themselves these days... #TransCriminal
Stylistically this is a horrible match up for Rousey, look at the stats. I won't be surprised if Rousey takes the L in January #UFC195
I don't like this "anime camera" though (I first saw it in the Naruto fighter)  feels like it discourages local play for 2nd player

Kane might just be going thru that 2nd season syndrome

Sam Smith's doing next James Bond theme?    Could be 1st one where instead of intro with Bond shooting toward camera, he just shoots himself.
im so sad Ed Sheeran is going to be in Atlanta on Saturday and im not going to see him
Swear to god if Sam Smith's singing the new Bond theme, I shall CRY.    Why? Just WHY would you do that?    I may be biased, but er..LANA!?!
Woeful start to the 3rd from Murray. Think this is lights out for him.
Sam smith is such a bad choice for the Bond song for Spectre like c'mon
@BAMAPERRY Hell it may be their idea to flood Europe with Muslims and then the take over begins world wide towel head dominance
Fine margins in tennis. I think if Murray had won that 1st set tie-break, he'd be preparing for the q/f. Disappointing end to slam season.

Murray with a splendid array of swear words at the end of the 2nd set. Sitting there with the commentator having to say, "sorry.  sorry."
Part of me hopes Abbott does it b/c I believe it will blow up in his face if he singles out Christians. It may take time for him to see why
Pretty stupid when you lie to the media: they may never believe you again. Sam Smith could have found a different answer!
Worth noting George Osborne must have known about the drone strike when he made his comments on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday #DroneGate
Absolutely mortified and gutted that Sam Smith may be doing the new Bond song :(
so mad I have school this week... if I didn't I would be in NYC because Shawn has a show tomorrow and the jacks have one the day after
@steelers Give Tom Brady the #crybabY and his New England Patriots their 1st loss of the season

This statement may seem heartless but the refugees in EU are another way to over run the west with Islam
Murray is pissed here and in the march! Hope he pulls it off #USOpen
@LilMissPrepper @USATODAY This may open the door for persecution of Christians.
Murray always struggles on Louis Armstrong. How pivotal was that person disrupting his serve causing him to  lose his mini break in the 1st?
They really just used a Rousey analogy for OSU? C'mon, man.
and FYI, I never had a HUGE problem with Kane; I just don't have respect for anyone who may of raped someone.
I worry about this huge update download tomorrow because my internet has been super sketchy latley.  Ps4 may be going to work with me. Lolz!
Why does everything have to be compared with Muslims. At just 13% more non-Muslims eat meat than Muslims in India. https://t.co/ylTgaLB4v6
You know you're a fag when you listen to music from naruto on Monday nights
Murray misses a good chance to break at the start of the 4th. Sloppy along with a brilliant shot from Anderson denies the break. #USOpen
Andy broken to start the 3rd set; still complaining to chair ump that 5 minutes is excessive bathroom usage time. Murray's so done. #USOpen
Murray in real trouble now, down a break in the 3rd #USOpen Looking angry and frustrated
White Sox are lowest scoring team in the American League https://t.co/sErqGihjuW
@theblaze Cynically, it may be that they realize their "team" is SO WEAK, that the less that is seen of them, the better. Draft Tom Brady?
Murray blew it! Just couldn't handle Anderson's first serve in the 4th set.
Sam Smith may have his fans but they certainly aren't the type of people that would watch Bond. What the hell have they done #SPECTRE
It's too bad the Red Sox didn't play this well in April, May, June, and July

Murray's serve broken in 1st service game 2nd set. I'm not watching any more. He does my  head in at times doing everything the hard way!
It sucks that I'm not even excited for the #SPECTRE theme tune debuting tomorrow, if it is Sam Smith it will really dampen my excitement.
Not the best start to the 2nd set from Murray, but our print editor is more focused on the fact that apparently both players "look scruffy"
Speightoo got court tomorrow I hope shit turn out to be gucci iono want my boa in that G wall

@Broflamingo let me rephrase the 3rd reason Fandom stuff.  if Naruto is the only anime you've seen then nope.
Murray's in major crisis here - 5 - 1 down in the 2nd set after losing the 1st! scenes!!
Murray a set down and 3-0 down in the 2nd set and bookies are laying Murray at Evens? Ridiculous
Murray can't be happy with that tie-break esp. What did he need to do better this match? #usopen https://t.co/aThIQd6RlI

@MadDogUnleashed be honest, if Ventura had thrown 1st pitch like Thor you all would be blasting him instead drooling on yourself? #Royals
Lol, get a grip #royals fans. I can forgive the HRs, but he biffed that pitch to Thor and then fell apart in the 4th https://t.co/5vyHq69IQn
Curtis is right: #SJSharks forwards coasting back to the D zone is not a formula for success. 3rd line didn't distinguish itself there.

@dubs_mike80 If Escobar was hurt I would hope you would be calling for Thor's suspension. If KC throws up tomorrow, you should have no prob
Roger Goodell do your job. Tom Brady is suspended 1st 4 games. Patriots forfeit any of those games he plays. #thatisall #bermanhasnopower

@robxkristen indeed, i thought Charlie Hebdo attacks were the wirse in january but no yesterday night was even worse ..
@aliceraee the Charlie Hebdo killers were French, so there's a high possibility these are French too. May as well just shoot everyone...
Hard to believe this is from January - Charlie Hebdo attacks prove critics were right about Islam https://t.co/SynkKRwodI via tennessean

@ladypunxxx whilst Trumps tweet is deplorable it was written in January post Charlie Hebdo. Look at the date on it
Like @HuffingtonPost apology, tomorrow when British a'thority will regret abt the error in Rahul Gandhi's nationality, will Media show that?
Charlie Hebdo shooting in January, bombing in June, attack on the train in August - @RobLowe has a point.

@MxJackMonroe @realDonaldTrump Tweeted January at time of Charlie Hebdo - stupid then (&amp; now) but not tweeted tonight.
I took my 1st class, Charlie Hebdo was attacked. I stand up with consistency, Paris is assaulted. Beware if I get a special.#MerdeALaMort
@Wielsucker @mewmewmew13 I think after Charlie Hebdo the French did NOT react as the US did after 9/11. But they may do this time around.
they actually went out just this January after the shooting at Charlie  Hebdo which makes today harder #PrayForParis https://t.co/0tGuzzkUA3
@Fixer_guy @realDonaldTrump not a Trump fan, but note this tweet is from January 7, date of the Charlie Hebdo shooting.
@Lucidmanx @johnson If the comment was in reference to the 'Charlie Hebdo' violent attack in january: it is no less repugnant. In my opinion
This was bozo Trump's moronic Charlie Hebdo tweet from back in January - not about last night's atrocity.  https://t.co/7PBfPcmaM9

To put things into perspective, 12 people died during the Charlie Hebdo attack in January. Today, the death toll is at 120 and rising #Paris
The attacks in #Paris come 10 months after the Charlie Hebdo shootings that left 17 people dead. These attackers picked Friday the 13th.

Just sat in  Bentley and watched a girl munch down on a whole bag of Chips.. And I'm not talking about the tiny bags. She had family size.
I am real mad that the replay of Saturday's Made In America Festival does not include Beyonce. Unhappy @TIDALHiFi subscriber!!!

Any NFL fans tell me why this new BBC deal only includes highlights on TV from November? Seems a bit late in the season. #NFL

As things stand, the bottom 3 in Serie A are Bologna (18th), Empoli (19th); and Juventus (20th).
