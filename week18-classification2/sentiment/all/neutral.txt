@GeoConservative @peltier_maggie and SCOTUS ruled any law outlawing same sex marriage is unconstitutional for violating the 14th
@GuyScott33 14TH AMENDMENT guarantees EQUAL PROTECTION so yeah. Oh &amp;, P.S., no, SCOTUS didn't write the law but DID correctly interpret it.
C'mon now the only black person on Seinfeld was the lawyer who was supposed to be an imitation of Cochrane https://t.co/ZCjNFyouJz
Remember on Seinfeld when Kramer got fired from job they never hired him for in the 1st place? Anyways enuf abt white ppl's advice for #BLM

Anybody asking what law #KimDavis broke needs to sit in on a 5th grade social studies class and learn the role of SCOTUS.
Stay up late, watch Seinfeld, make Steve drive tomorrow.
@MauriceBear21 she may beat Steffi or Serena's Open Era Record of titles, who knows at this point.
@Pqlyur1 SCOTUS interprets laws, and since by their interpretation it is protected by the 14th amendment it is technically a const violation
@DeepSouthProud @bryanbleano @DynaMoChen the States ensured SCOTUS could take this action by enacting 14th Amendment
@JSException @FoxNews  You may be right. However, Lincoln didn't listen to the SCOTUS when they said black people were not humans.
@Israeli_Queen You are aware that SCOTUS said that it fell under two sections of the 14th Admendment right?
@scrowder What if SCOTUS says 2nd amendment arms don't mean guns and elected official disregards it?
Sarah Palin may want us to speak American, but if she is in President Trump's cabinet many of us will be speaking Canadian.  Andy Borowitz
World, I think it may be time to accept that nothing Larry David did after Seinfeld has been funny.
Religious freedom, purposely protected by 1st A., is now trampled by the SCOTUS decision on gay marriage.#ImWithKim http://t.co/uarVbr8BE3
@alphainparis 14th Amendment is the one used by SCOTUS in the marriage equality ruling. @gshevlin
@solemnoathbeer @TheBruery To paraphrase Seinfeld: are you going to double dip?  This pic (of wax cover) looks much different than 1st pic.
.@JTSoutherland What the 14th says or doesn't say is not up to you. The words have meanings. Legally, SCOTUS decides. They have.

@aquapub I know I'm stupid but it seems SCOTUS has established marriage as a right via 14th. Kim was denying people who legally qualified.
Serena defeat Venus again only this time Venus put up a fight and made to a 3rd set unlike last time i saw it #usopen
I'm finding my life and the dialogue around me are right out of a Seinfeld episode. Many of you may think this is fun, but it's unnerving.
@Billd111 @megynkelly @tedcruz SCOTUS has determined that the 14th amendment guarantees equal access to marriage for all citizens
Serena has no mercy for her sister . 6-3 on the 3rd set and match #USOpen

Tiger Woods shot a 3rd round 68 on Saturday to tie for 2nd at the Wyndham Championship after 54 holes. Woods trails Jason Gore by two shots.

...I KNOW the sexy pick for NL ROTY is Kris Bryant .257/16/66 1st rd., but Matt Duffy? .310/10/59 18th rd. ...Duffy has more hits overall...
Dustin Johnson would have several majors under his belt if only the Thursday / Friday rounds counted
Paper Towns is released in the UK tomorrow and I have nobody to watch it with.  *cries eternally*
If Dustin Johnson makes par at the 1st instead of quad, we have a ball game. He's still fun to watch
The signs on Dunkin doors should say see you tomorrow instead of see you soon
As sure as the sun coming up everyday, Dustin Johnson implodes at a Sunday major #PGAChampionship
At least Dustin Johnson didn't hang around til the end to lose this major..i think he's hitting his 7th shot on 1st hole. Still not on green
Gonna be a long day for Dustin Johnson... starts the final round of the #PGAChampionship with a quadruple bogey on the 1st hole.
Dustin Johnson is -8 over the last 14 holes.  Oh for that quad on the 1st....
@SPeetGolfEast @JamesKent85 Hate to see it. Dustin Johnson on the 1st. #headsgone

Murray sprinting along baseline getting everything back to the South African. But 3rd BP saved.
With a win and Baltimore loss, Red Sox are tied for fourth place with the Orioles. First time since June 7 Sox have been in 4th place.
