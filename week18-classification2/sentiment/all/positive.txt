Tonight's episode of Monday Night Raw was lit af, the Dudley boys,Ric Flair, and Sting!! Like yo wth!
Thursday night Must-See TV hasn't been this comical since the Friends &amp; Seinfeld one-two punch. #GOPDebate
All I see is the Seinfeld logo.  https://t.co/vtIOqt0oVV
@ouij my mother baby sat Ric Flair. #woo my brush with fame.
@LaurenceWHolmes What do you mean, Laurence? The Dudleys, Ric Flair, and Sting were on Raw Monday. Taker wrestled Sunday. It IS the 90s.
If @MsCharlotteWWE defeats Nikki Bella at #nightofchampions, it Should be similar to how Ric Flair beat Dusty Rhodes to win his 1st title
If Rick Perry does not win the election, he has lost nothing as he is a strong family man, and a true Christian. https://t.co/jfo2HrUnv8
22 years ago I saw Ric Flair wrestle at age 3, in the very building I'll see @MsCharlotteWWE wrestle in tomorrow night. Mindblowing!!
Personally, I like Rick Perry and appreciate what he did for Texas. But as president...dunno. He may start a war by mispronouncing something
Someone come and see Seinfeld with me in November!!!!!!
14yrs Rick Perry ran the 12th largest economy in the WORLD,left with 18bil Surplus 27Mill people &amp; created ALL of the job growth in America!
Rick Perry succeeded with 12th largest economy in the world Texas He will be a successful President for all American  http://t.co/9cx5S19nIw
@MotionToStrike New Yorkers *get* Seinfeld and the humor and setting in the same way that Texans understand Friday Night Lights
LOL. I am quit sure that isn't the future 4 Rick Perry. He is the 1 that will give us back what we lost. We need him https://t.co/oQUc4jLoaH
The what's a better show debate, Seinfeld vs Friends is one for the ages but you may be mentally incompetent if you think Friends is better.
.@marklevinshow's Friday first hour focused on the SCOTUS unconstitutional redefinition of marriage, and the case of #KimDavis.  Excellent!
@WWE Ready to see @JohnCena  win the championship for the 16th time.  Tying the legend Ric Flair
He needs to walk tomorrow, flip the bat and begin strutting like Ric Flair  https://t.co/YsoheO2W6Z
To quote Seinfeld's Kramer, Monday has a feel; Wed has a feel, and FRIDAY has a feel. Here's to feeling the first Friday of the school year!
Obama gets Iran victory, TABOR gets another black eye, &amp; Rick Perry prepares for the end. http://t.co/NnsWyecpHZ #copolitics #copols #coleg
About to watch about 15 episodes of Seinfeld till work is over, fuck 3rd shift
About to see Ant Man... I don't expect it to be as good as A Bug's Life, Antz, or Seinfeld's "the Bee Movie"... But I may BEE surprised
@A10Jim @ninaland @WoodhullSFA And that's why SCOTUS has the last word on what laws states may enact and enforce. Hence "Supreme Court."
@Jakethehater @BrandonSprague @TheDirtJohnson @TaylorADanforth Seinfeld when Kramer is lost and confused, "I'm on the corner of 1st and 1st?

Happy 60th birthday actor Wayne Knight / In Seinfeld and Third Rock from the Sun, you may sight.
I hope that when @RonFunches wins @midnight for the 16th time, Ric Flair comes out to congratulate him. Unless Jon Stewart interferes.
Rick Perry is amazing. His speech was the best hands down. #perry2016 https://t.co/97j8jIe8tE
I just took a Coach Freeze clip out of the new @HeadtoHeadRadio intro, to make room for Ric Flair. I love my job. New intro debuts tomorrow!
Better take another look at Rick Perry.  Best record in the 12th largest world economy. AAA rating. https://t.co/BGcwYhhazc

I really hope that Obama attends Serena's match on Saturday...Ciara's doing the National Anthem. Give us deze ratings biches.
@kanani_lol what a waste. It even has the last man on earth, Seinfeld, South Park and Monday night raw. Hulu is awesome
Now that I've calmed down after watching Serena.... Do you realize how great tomorrow's Vika-Simona match is gonna be??
@jon_wertheim @BenRothenberg It played out like Serena took off the 2nd set. An in form Vika MIGHT make her pay. Might.
Serena won, but big sister Venus gave her the flux! Congrats to both of them for giving us a great tennis match. https://t.co/brJ29dzm2X
Interested to see what kind of ratings the U.S. Open final gets on Saturday with Serena presumably going for history up against CFB.
Couldn't hang on to stay up and watch 3rd set but it was nice to see Serena beat Venus. What a resilient, tough player Venus is, tho.
This may be hard to believe: I am watching Seinfeld's "The Contest" for the very first time.
@900amWURD @WURD_SRenee Thankfully @KendoKennyL and I will be going to the USOpen Finals this Sat prayerfully to see Serena make history
@Alisha12287 I live 5 minutes from there. In fact my dads company is a sponsored company for it. I'm seeing Snoop Dogg there on Saturday :)
Happy for Serena. I want her to win the 22nd GS, tie Steffi and win the CYGS. @usopen #usopen
I have heard it said that the 2nd G in Snoop Dogg represents extra gangsterishness, for how else do you explain this particular redundancy?

Serena beat her sister Venus in the quarter finals.She is 2 matches away to the 4th successive Grand Slam in a row #USOpen2015

Serena reaches her 7th semifinals of the #USOpen in a row. Two more matches to complete the Grand Slam.
Answer: Moi. Question: Who's seeing Serena play in the semifinals on Thursday?
Popcorn and Seinfeld sounds like the perfect friday night... #ithinkimgettingold
@nytimes Bitter /Sweet - Serena may almost not have wanted to win. BUT - their  father Richard always taught them, to do the best they can.
@NACHO2813 @Joe_Schmucc But he is shirking the gap between him and Eddie year by year. No one is catching Seinfeld, but he may catch Eddie.
@morganameridius @disquietus now back in the day I watched a good bit. Friends, Seinfeld, 3rd Rock, 70s show. But as I got older not much
I hope every young girl watched the Williams sisters tonight. Serena may have won but they'll go down as the greatest sibling duo ever!
@Omojuwa serena won her Q/final match against venus. she will play unseeded italian roberta vinci in the semis on Thursday #USOpen2015

Which on its surface may seem counterintuitive, but the marginal utility of Seinfeld obviously increases at an increasing rate.
George's stories may be my favorite thing about Seinfeld - he is so passionate it's wonderful
For my high schoolers : tomorrow if you get approached by anyone you don't want to talk to just tell them your ideal hangout with Snoop Dogg
Ok so Serena may have won but Venus wore hoops to the match and you know how I feel about hoops
Imagine going home before Sunday and missing Snoop Dogg hahahaha

@katetscott Best moment on air Tue.: GR " you look down on me because I don't smoke. KS "Yeah" "C'mon Gary you and me 420 and watch Serena"
Venus was serving and passing better, but she donated some UFEs in the 3rd set. Serena played the big points better for the win. #USOpen2015

My morning alarm is the Imperial March from Star Wars.  The feelings of dread act just like coffee.

Preaching theme this Sunday: David &amp; Bathsheba -- with band doing cover of Sting's "Every Breath U Take (I'll be watching U)" #yeahbaby
@KevinLive5 thanks! I know you would have the answer. Hope all is well! I'm sure Sting last Monday had you jacked up with energy!
@AshleyJJ__ yea that's what they said at T-Mobile that it comes out in October
@jimmykorderas I congratulate you on using Vince logic not because Sting is old he would never let a WCW star win the strap in his 1st year

It's Wednesday! Best week in a long time. Batman, Harley, Star Wars, Saga. Ant Man toys, TONS more. Love it!! http://t.co/x62ZNgqVV0
@AbiWilks Sting may give you some ideas. https://t.co/Vs72Ps9MfV
According to @SalSports we may see little to none of Matt Cassel tonight. Predominately T-Mobile and EJ
And the show goes on! Scorpions' Sting at 3 p.m. Come down; the sun is even peeking through.
@FredRichani If you wanna do Rock vs Brock and Taker vs Sting at wm 32. Survivor Series on his 25th anniversary would be the place to end it
4 yr old who attended Saturday's Star Wars event came in today to tell me he made 4 new friends that day. #childrenslibrarian #lovemyjob

"@AnishJain50: Sting opens Monday night Raw! #StingonRaw" although with a crappy promo. @MrGriffinB #NightOfChampions
And it all ends,   with Sting!  Monday Night Raw, was absolutely,  WAY more better, then Summerslam.  #StingVsRollins   #RawBrooklyn
Even better, just found out that I won 3 tickets to Sunday's STL/SD game via the T-Mobile 3-for-1 Sweepstakes! Thanks @TMobile and @MLB!
@Pillownaut 1978. I missed Star Wars and Saturday Night Fever but made it in time for Grease, so there's that.
Watching some classic WCW Monday Nitro. Love reliving the NWO and Sting feud. Thanks @EBischoff For everything. WCW will live forever
Sting winning at #NightOfChampions results in either Sting vs Taker at Mania or Sting vs Cena and I've got a bad feeling it's the 2nd option
Credit to WCW. Bubba beat Sting in May, since that time they've decided to put Bubba vs Hogan tonight - Bubba has done *NOTHING* since
@NickGator well, at least you can see Sting's 1st WWE title win for only 9.99
And @TripleH may have " hand picked " @WWERollins but @StephMcMahon and Sting is right- Rollins is not half the man HHH is. #RAW
Rock out this Wednesday morning with this amazing song by Robert Downey Junior and Sting! The lyrics are... http://t.co/UbRgslnY5j
Going on record, Sting wins belt at NoC, drops it at the MSG show on the 3rd. If I'm wrong, ya can have open season on me.
Including his TNA title wins, Sting is a 14-time World Champion. Beating Seth would tie him with Cena for 2nd of all time. @wwe #raw
Ich habe ein @YouTube-Video positiv bewertet: http://t.co/4njhci2kuC Sting saves Randy Orton from the Authority: WWE Raw, March 16,

Not that I don't love Seth Rollins, he's gold on the belts. But this may be Sting's only title run sooo #StingOnRaw #RAW #RawTampa
@TheFrayMovement Considering that Sting might have a two-month run w/ the title after being the 3rd wheel to Braun Strowman... yeah

"Did you know Star Wars is coming out with a new movie in December?!?!" - third grade boy
@ryan24672 @CMPuLs3 And it'd work, Seth getting the rub and being Sting's 2nd ever opponent + a month long reign with both titles is BIG
I'm getting the gut feeling that Sting will win the WWE title belt(which'll drive the wrestling podcasters insane) https://t.co/KozEyUa5Mn
I honestly think I'm still Marking Out from last night's #RAW... 1st the Dudley Boyz...  Then Ric Flair... And then Sting!! :D #WWE

Tom Cruise may have a private life I dont agree with, but in terms of his film career, he's been in so many greats he has my utmost respect.
So much Tom Cruise in my eyeballs tonight. But the dude made some good choices. Edge of Tomorrow? Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation? GOOD
I still can't believe Tom Cruise from Top Gun Is coming to our school Friday for USA day!!!
not a bit ashamed to say I have preplanned LOTS of jokes about the Queen/parasitology to troll my Tory royalist classmates tomorrow
Tom Cruise was 24 when he was in Top Gun. Meanwhile, I just laughed at a fart joke and don't want to go to work tomorrow morning.
Can't wait for golf tomorrow #group1 psyche rocking out in  the 3rd group . I'm worse than the new tiger woods

@freedmanhp4 @JohnRentoul @lordbonkers May be good news for UKIP too though Corbyn is the most Eurosceptic leader since Michael Foot.

Watched Ant-Man for the 2nd time today, and thought of 2 more reasons to see it again: to catch the Easter eggs and catalog its Britishisms.
@Mistah_Whiskahs @jcynda @bradisinnewyork saw my 1st concert in 91 acdc then saw nirvana at the big day out WOW still remember likeyesterday
Catching up on WWE for the week thanks to the Saturday night reruns. Seth Rollins is underappreciated.
I would say, Ant-Man is probably my favorite movie of the year so far with MI: Rogue Nation at a very close 2nd
Paid my bills, bought some groceries, did a bit of price-shopping on some clothes, and bought my ticket for Ant-Man later tonight. #Saturday
Unexpected development-- saw Ant-Man on Saturday night in London. It was surprisingly charming. I actually quite enjoyed it.

Dustin Johnson has a great chance to win the @PGAChampionship as long as there is no Sunday round. @DJohnsonPGA
Remembering how normal it was to see Ice Cube at our high school all the time     Sat right in front of him at a play too lmao
When Chuck Norris decides to wake, he makes the sun rise.  When he goes to bed, the sun sets, if it knows whats good for it.
Thank you very much Dustin Johnson. 1st round leader never in doubt!
I guess one 80s action star is much the same as any other. Can't wait for Chuck Norris's remake of Junior. https://t.co/SLIaOSUzP2
The Blue Jays are playing very well. They're scoring runs and David Price is pitching like David Price. 3-0 Jays with one out in the 5th

Ice Cube is like 7th on my Greatest MC list and he is #2 in my diss records list.
When I was in 8th grade, all I wanted to be when I grew up was the lead singer of a Nirvana cover band.

I'll use a more recent example. When was the last time you got excited about a "new Ice Cube record?" By most standards he may be top 25 OAT
@baghdadinvest @abbasnasir59 Not just Christians, you are in the prayers of "all of us" humans.May you stay safe and be free soon!God bless.
Even with the loss of the 5 dudes, I think we'll feel better about Hamels in December when the Dodgers give David Price $200 million.
Sat alone downstairs in the dark with Sam smith on, might grab myself a beer or vodka as well. Living life to the maxxxxx
My mom and I sat in the bathroom all night jamming nirvana and painting our nails &amp; just talking. Probably the best night I've had in awhile
Back from Ant-Man for the 2nd time! Love that film.
Janet Jackson &amp; Luther the best for Saturday cleaning
I don't know why but the song, Staring At The Sun by Jason Aldean makes me feel better
I would love instead of the Miss USA pageant, we would have like a Miss SAT pageant
Janet Jackson will be in the Queen City on Friday, September 18th at the PNC Music Pavilion! Are you ready?
Is this the 1st time Kpop has been nominated in the TCAs? Even if we don't win, isn't that still an achievement we should be proud of!
But on the real there may never be a bigger rapper/activist/filmmaker/businessman better than Ice Cube...
Even tho I finished the manga, anytime I watch Naruto that shit gets me emotional. I've been read/watching since 4th grade fam
@cakeftziall_ Thank you! Maybe this may attract more American fans to Kpop? Or maybe even Kpop fans to English pop?

Dad: "I'll go watch Paper Towns with you on Thursday.."     Yes then!
@ajhmate Yes!!!! Lol. I think Andy mentioned her on the July 12th show and Audrey actually mentioned him on Big Brother too lol. Loves him.
Some round from Dustin Johnson considering he started with an 8 on the 1st. Another case of what might've been for him at Whistling Straits.
Randy Orton opening the show tonight like he should be on Sunday. #SummerSlam #Raw -BW
Since Friday, I've been walking around reciting the lyrics to No Vaseline by Ice Cube. It's like I'm a kid again! Wait...

Monday Night Raw in 1 hour John Cena returns plus Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker in the same building could go wild on USA Network
Straight Outta Compton dragged a little in the 3rd act but was very good. Laughs, tears. And O'Shea Jackson Jr. WAS Ice Cube!
Clocked in. PC on. Headphones in. Pearl Jam, Nirvana, David Bowie, Barry Manilow (Don't judge me) playlist on .. Right Monday bring it on
According to Janet Jackson's long time producer Terry Lewis, the album is due in October.    STAY CONNECTED!... http://t.co/VMZrL5gsAc

"If you are not entertained when turning WWE on a Monday night  then there's something wrong with you." - Brock Lesnar. I agree.
emI Am Cait/em, the E! Entertainment reality show about Caitlyn Jenner, premieres Sunday night
Brock Lesnar to appear on @SportsCenter tomorrow at 9am oughta make good television. I wonder what mood he'll be in.
Rolling Stone and The Zone are the best songs on Thursday
I'm really hoping Seth Rollins finds a way to win on Sunday. I don't want to see Cena reign #16. No thanks.
A very wonderful and much expected call from the Super Eagles handler Sunday Oliseh, Mikel and Moses don't deserve a call up for now.
I think it's fair to say that Brock Lesnar is winning this Sunday #raw @WrestlingInc

Brock Lesnar's the best thing going in wrestling.     There's not even a close 2nd.

David Wright goes down swinging on fourth AB. Had a couple nice looks. Just couldn't connect. He's at third to start the 8th. #Mets
Love or hate, Ryan Braun is playing some fantastic baseball as of late. @Brewers may be out of it, but it's not because of him. #justsaying
@KathieLGifford When I hear the words Monday Night Football I still think Frank Gifford. Thank you for sharing his testimony on the air!
i just saw last monday night raw now and @JohnCena came and made Seth Rollins and the authority shut the hell up love it #nevergiveup #wwe
Funimation's Tokyo Ghoul trailer was very strategic putting from the studio of Yu Yu Hakusho &amp; Naruto &amp; Bleach. Put the highest quality 1st
They shud've skipped all the stuff abt the Chronic &amp; Ice Cube writing Friday &amp; skipped to them bcoming cool w/ Eazy. Other stuff irrelevant
My money is on John Cena.. And Brock Lesnar... Two of the best matches you'll get to see on Sunday!!!!!!!!!!!!
Our lives as Christians may be the only Bible some people read. So it's important that as Christians we live it to the very best. Goodnight!
Sheamus is going to win on Sunday since he was pinned by Randy Orton more than once since Battleground.
Brock Lesnar on sportscenter talking about his fight with the Undertaker this Sunday.... What a time to be alive
.@FGaryGray interesting metatextual touch with Ice Cube's son delivering the "Bye Felicia" line from Friday to the girl at the party in SOC.
If you are a real MMA fan then UFC 194 will probably be the 2nd best card of the year I wouldn't put the Rousey card in the top 10
Radio just played U2's "Bad". Which rarely happens &amp; is one of my very favorite songs of all time so my day may have just peaked very early.
Friday morning special guest live in studio.  Drake White just got the opening slot on the Zac Brown Band tour... http://t.co/5W5OGtQj5O
The #ByeFelicia scene is brilliant in @ComptonMovie considering that it originated from #Friday which @FGaryGray directed and Ice Cube wrote

@e_jaculation but we mustn't forget that on the 7th day, God gave us a Nicki -- Miley take down of epic proportions. Rejoice my child.
This sums up everything about Kanye West. I may not like him as a person, but I love him as an artist. #VMAs
I'll set my DVR to record the encore so I can watch Nicki's performance tomorrow.

This Red Sox team, this one, start over in May they win the pennant and good chance at WORLD SERIES ..........GO SOX
15-30 on Murray's serve, but the Scot more up than down finally and grabs the hold of serve with a couple of aces.    Andy up 4-3* 3rd set.

Murray has this. He may not have it at the moment but I'm not worried #USOpen #murray

Murray stays alive! He wins the 3rd set 7-6! #USOpen #tennis
Lets go Andy! Murray wins the 3rd set, down 1-2. #usopen #andymurray
Murray's form has been tremendous this year ... a win tonight would've seen him reach 60 victories in a season for just the 2nd time
There are so many Foo Fighters songs I'd love to see live, but I think February Stars is the one I'd like to see the most

Murray does well to hold. 5-4 to Murray. Anderson to serve to stay in the 3rd set #USOpen
Really great match this now. Anderson is going for broke on every Murray 2nd serve, and Murray is winning most rally points now. #USOpen2015
Holy shit Murray &amp; Anderson have been battling for 4+ hours on Grandstand. Only the 4th set. #USOpen
@tonyredmen1 Hey Tony saw you in the pit at Foo Fighters on Saturday, but didn't have the chance to say hi! Did you have a good evening?

There's a little less than a month left of baseball, I see no reason why the Red Sox can't get the 2nd wildcard

People who know baseball know Thor is the player of the game cause after the 2nd inning he started dealing and kept mets alive
Selena Gomez presented Amy Schumer with an award and a heap of praise at the Hollywood Film Awards on November 1.
I want to dress up as Thor tomorrow and wear a Syndergaard jersey.
Alright people, you've been waiting for it. Dark Souls. 1 Death = 1 Jalapeno. Tomorrow at 11am PST.  RIP me. https://t.co/9whelmPciD
I like how Thor is bragging about making Esky uncomfortable as if he didn't give up 6 hits and 3 runs in 1st 2 innings.
Chase Fourcade with the 8 yard TD run to give @ArchRUMMEL a 7-0 lead over Curtis with 5 seconds left in 1st quarter.
Briana made a playlist of songs that remind her of me and the 3rd one to come on was All I want for Christmas by Mariah Carey:')
Thor's going to make Herrera pay tomorrow night. Mets have the enforcer on the mound https://t.co/qzXkM2hiXn
Away. Away. Away. Syndergaard peppering outside of the plate and then busts pitches inside. Thor has found his groove. 5K. Top 6th.
Nice drive lead by Chris Evans and 2 pt. conversion good to make it 14-14 7:59 left in 3rd  @ISNation @IHSAA1 via @mopistatguy

"I'll give you a hint, you wanna play it but you think it'll be too hard." "OH OH OH PRAISE THE SUN." "Yes, Dark Souls."

@Official_NCFC looking better already now Curtis is sat on the bench
@WpgHockTalk true, but I thought the 5 on 5 play was pretty even though well into the 3rd. You didn't? That Mighty Thor goal huge.
The reason TFI isn't as good now is cos the 1st time around Chris Evans was on the verge of a breakdown and it was incredible watching him

Was reading Dark Souls 3 may be last Souls game.  That'd be good.  Keep it special, you know?
@JuugmanCape Hi May name is Briana nice to meet you sir! Im new and town just wanna meet some people
@LoyalLadySif it's queen. Nevertheless,Thor shook those feelings off as he and Sif approached their table and sat down
@OfIceAndBlood Owen grinned, this may be a little easier. "I've heard a lot about you from Thor and Chris. It's lovely to meet you!"
@JustAnIronMan It's not just a helmet to me. [He sighs, muttering under his breath before answering him.] As for Thor, he's back tomorrow.

Mj had 12, Kendrick with 11 on an album our culture didnt love at 1st, although grammys are hit &amp; miss in hip hop hes influencing people
Can't wait for the picture of Kendrick holding 11 Grammys to surface so I can be like "this is for the people in March calling TPAB trash"
@Campbell_Soupss I liked it a lot. Held my attention much better than Dark Souls. I may have to go back to that now.
Sun 12/06:  Thor the Elf hanging out on our TV this morning. #ThortheElf2015 https://t.co/i8uC5r7XGk
Super-happy for Kendrick today but the reality is he'll lose 90% of those nominations in February and then it's back to hating the Grammys.
Welp I got 3/5 right for AOTY, Kendrick deserves it but it may come down to Taylor or The Weeknd
But ya...I'm just waiting for February so that Cole and Kendrick can drop their collabo album.
I can't stop listening to Black Friday by Kendrick Lamar. Everything about that song is so right! Turned a J. Cole track into one of his own
Watching 'Inside Amy Schumer' for the 1st time. She's funny, sassy, smart, beautiful...&amp; sleeps with a teddy bear in one sketch. I'm hooked.
i can listen to J. Cole's and Kendrick Lamar's Black Friday on repeat all day.

@realDonaldTrump @Poptartmom Thank you, Donald Trump. You honor our dead by standing against Iran Deal on 14th Anniversary of 9/11.

I would definitely be okay with Eric Church playing Springsteen at least 3 times tomorrow night.  #grettune
Remembering that time I said "may the force be with you" to Buzz Lightyear at Disneyland ... #toinfinitiandbeyond
@andriagray Saw him in indy with Eric Church, Brantley &amp; others. 1st act started @5 and kenny started around 9.
Donald Trump tweets:    May I tell you that I'm having a lovely Labor Day weekend at Hugh Hefner's place? Hef is a gentleman and a friend.

A SO to @BurlsCreek for the most amazing night @BootsandHearts Eric Church and then theafter party. Tomorrow @LeahDaniels and @EmersonDrive

i may be a big old grump in places children tend to be but you just can't be a grump at disneyland you're a kid too at disneyland
I'm ready for Thursday and Eric Church with @kranina
As happy as I am to be going to Disneyland this Saturday,  I wish I was going next Friday for Dapper Day instead.
That awkward moment when @jccaylen is in Disneyland and you're not.. You better be there when I go in November hint hint
who's going to Kenny and Eric Church tomorrow and wants to tailgate with @dougzundelll and I?
I have two tickets for Eric Church tomorrow night at the new amphitheater if anyone is interested
May Allah bless Erdogan with wisdom and capacity to move forward.   https://t.co/oYUrHH6fui

Nashville will be rocking downtown with 4 concerts tomorrow night, Dolly Parton. Shania Twain, Eric Church and The Monkeys!! 4 venues
I can't wait for Donald Trump to get elected president and then end the oath of office with "live from New York, it's Saturday Night!"
Can I just go to Disneyland for my 21st or is that super lame lol
Start Monday morning with a NEW song from Eric Church! http://t.co/pXOZvIzzrk http://t.co/i5KVZDdchL
On this day in 1955, Disneyland welcomed its one-millionth guest, just seven weeks after its July 17th grand opening.http://t.co/D8SOhK5QE7
@SMShow  Donald Trump will tilt the planet away from the sun. It'll be marvelous and you're gonna love it.
Note to self for tomorrow: Come to Tim McGraw much earlier than you did for Eric Church... The track entrance is moving SLOW.
I'll be at Disneyland tomorrow; if you see us, CAW CAW or give me a hug &lt;3 http://t.co/80umMo9W8q
"She looks nice! It says she loves sleeping in on Saturdays, college fb games, not acting her age, and good bbq" "Mar that's Eric Church.."
@NerdistMom It's weird that in the 1st set Federer &amp; Isner went game for game until the tiebreak. Then Federer trucked him in the tiebreak
Ready to fall in love with Eric Church on Saturday
Federer is my 2nd fave male tennis player of all time right after the great Arthur Ashe.
Federer breaks early in the 2nd set! Even consolidates the break! Up 3-0! #RF #Tennis #CincyTennis
Federer will play another final tomorrow. This guy is just amazing. #CincyTennis
Thursday I was at Eric Church, last night I was at OAR, tonight I'm in my pajamas already watching Cars. Rock star life.
@JohnIsner I concur with your coach. Its you! #AmexTennis Good luck tomorrow against Federer!
Let's see how many couples are going to start dry humping when Eric Church sings wrecking ball tomorrow #CountryJam
Eric Church was absolutely amazing last Saturday...he never disappoints http://t.co/unLI6ZvoHT
Federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots.
@Jim_Hulbert Federer faced the highest ranked guy in R1. His draw is tricky. So is Murray's.If Fed reaches the QFs, then he may meet Berdy.
Some outrageous shots from Federer in the tiebreak. The clean half volley return of a Djokovic 2nd serve just about the best of them.
LAST CHANCE!!! I have 2 Eric Church tickets for tomorrow night at the State Fair. PLEASE text or message me if interested!
Wow, tragic start from Federer in the 3rd
Floatin soaking up some sun n some Eric church. Can it get any better than this?
it may look like im going to hard to trap music while driving right now but i assure you i'm listening to fleetwood mac
No doubt my mom will either faint or take her top off when she meets Eric Church tomorrow
I believe #Rafa could win a 3rd #USOpen title if he can make it to the semifinals at least because of Federer, Murray, etc. #usopenworld
Can't wait to see eric church tomorrow with @tcoriell ! #drinkalittledrink #smokealittlesmoke
Federer stays winning. Into the finals tomorrow.
Excited for the Federer vs. Djokovic final in Cincinnati tomorrow afternoon. Should be some great tennis!
@froggy1013 it's good! Drink in my hand- eric church may be about my life though.. #requestingasongviatwitter
Way to go Roger.  Old man Federer just keeps rolling along.  #Djokernole v. #Fed for the final tomorrow.  #CincyTennis
Last year, majority of the Federer matches took place primetime.  This year, it's the other way around.  2nd on Ashe tomorrow
All though Federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter I think Gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen
Federer's second serve placement is awesome. That's why he's the best server ever. Nobody has better placement on 1st or 2nd serve
@mmunro91 I may have never seen a player play a higher tennis level than I just saw, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic included. Make no mistake,
Federer beats Murray 6-4, 7-6(6) to reach #CincyTennis final. He'll be going for his 7th title vs Novak Djokovic, who is going for his first
Laying out in the sun with Eric Church and the lake in the background #perfection #carolina #LaborDay
New @TennisPodcast tomorrow, reviewing Federer, Serena and the pre US Open storylines. This is what we sound like https://t.co/2x0O2UDCe8
Just like in the 2nd, Federer breaks back.
@rosequartz0518 @_claudiaw Beep beep...! Yep, Murray and Federer into the top 16. Phew! :) See you tomorrow!
Gonna have to DVR this Isner and Federer match... This thing is good. Getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. #USOpen2015
@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!
Not going to be able to watch Federer's match vs Darcis but expect to wake up tomorrow to read of a comprehensive victory for the Swiss.
That ending of 2nd set TB by Federer, he really is the original son of Jor-el
Love this new trick that Federer has when he is facing a 2nd serve. Running up to the serve line and taking it early is unreal!
For the 1st time, Federer has beaten No.1 and No.2 players in the ATP Rankings in consecutive matches en route to a title. #CincyTennis
Yes, Federer's attacking return is brilliant.  But yes, it's a play club players can do too, esp. off weak and predictable 2nd serves
You may not know this, but before he was a famous country star . . . Eric Church was a KNIFE salesman.  He talked... http://t.co/TifssYucK8
Federer just won his 15th straight point on his serve... Lol wow
Federer breaks his own record with a 14th appearance at the ATP Finals after reaching the US QF #FinalShowdown http://t.co/ugI3PQBp8w
Monday at the US Open: Murray, Federer &amp; Konta are all in action at Flushing Meadows today http://t.co/50ZM0cOEjT http://t.co/YlLS4kf0of
Fognini is I believe only the 3rd one to beat Nadal 3 or more times in a year - the others (no points for guessing) Federer and Djokovic.
With his consistency in playing great tennis, i am sure Federer will crush Gasquet in the QF. C'mon Federer!! http://t.co/LHCEhZo26g
@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though. But 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against Stan or Murray
Federer is looking good after winning Cincy for the 7th time.
Federer defeats Kohlschreiber 6-3 6-4 6-4 to go through to the 4th Round @usopen
Federer's 1st serve is just...perfect. #USOpen
Federer rebounds from 3-5 down in the 2nd set tb to take it 8-6. Leads Isner. 7-6(0) 7-6(6) #usopen
Friday night cruising through Tennessee, listening to Eric Church with my love #bliss
23rd of August was such a nice day, England lift Ashes, Bolt won 100 m and Federer beats Djokovic in Cincinati.
Federer breaks the Kohlschreiber serve!! Federer is on red hot form &amp; doesnt look like stopping. Fed leads 2-0 in the 1st set #USOpen
What dreams forget, the whisky remembers. Kinda like molasses in late December, justa creepin'. - Eric Church.
Darcis stops the bleeding by winning his 1st game since 1-0 in the first serve. Well, one kind of bleeding because Federer's still leading.
Federer overtakes Lendl for second longest streak of being seeded at the US Open in the Open Era. 15th straight year. Connors leads with 18.
The 1st week of the 2015 #USOpen is almost up &amp; the big names of Serena, Venus, Djokovic, Murray, Federer &amp; Wawrinka are still in the draw.
@tsExtraTime @BenRothenberg Novak is surely the man to beat. Federer or Murray may run him to the base line. The usual suspects.
I believe the loss at RG to Wawrinka was first time in a decade Federer didn't break once in a GS match. This might be the 2nd. #USOpen2015
Federer is about to be done with his match in the same time the 5th set of the Hewitt vs. Tomic match takes!

Federer defeats Darcis 6-1 6-2 6-1 to advance to 3rd Round at the @usopen accomplishing a perfect 16-0 in 2nd Round
You'll love this. @FedfanTejal #BlastFromThePast, Federer, Murray, Serena, Djokovic. Its got it all. #WorthTheRead  https://t.co/4hducxvFiP
Serena punches her ticket to the finals in straight sets. Joins Djokovic and Federer in tomorrow's #CincyTennis singles finals. Decent trio.
Jo Konta's win over Muguruza was the longest ever Women's #USOpen match &amp; the 1st set alone lasted as long as Federer's entire match! Woah!
Good starts for Federer and Stosur. Berdych level at 1-1 after winning the 2nd set!
What a great day for world sport: Usain got his 9th gold, Federer claimed Cincinnati Title no 7 and I pumped some weights. #truepro
Wow, Federer wastes 3 bps with 3 Isner's 2nd serves. Fed 0/8 on bps tonight
@davelackie @heathermarrin we may have had a small Fleetwood Mac style party in your yard but it's okay we invited the neighbors lolol
Ok time to check back in with tennis - Isner and Federer heading into a 2nd tiebreak
Take me back to Friday night to the Eric church concert
I think I may have popped my ear drums and a vain in my head from singing along to Fleetwood Mac very loudly down the parkway #noregrets
Anyone going to the Eric Church concert on Saturday?
Three bands who could have challenged @ledzeppelin : 1st Jeff Beck Group, Free and Fleetwood Mac (with Peter Green).
.@richardgasquet1 honing his game on P3 Court for his match with Federer tomorrow. #USOpen http://t.co/aMKlvtlaqx
Djokovic v Federer should be good one tomorrow. Fancy the Swiss, can't see Djokovic coming back if he falls behind in this one.
"Papa you need a hat" thus said one of Federer's twin girls.......congrats again for winning Cinci for the 7th time @rogerfederer
Add to the results, Federer over Djokovic  and Lewis Hamilton, and it's not a bad Sunday at all!
