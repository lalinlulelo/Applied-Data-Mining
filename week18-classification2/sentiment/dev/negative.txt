The amount of people on Facebook sharing the Daily Currant article about Sarah Palin is hilarious. (Guys, it's satire. C'mon people.)
Why in God's name would CNN have Sarah Palin on tomorrow? There's no one else from Alaska who can talk about Obama's visit?
Ohio has defined marriage as one man and one woman, if SCOTUS now writes law, guess Ohio has no law and you may marry who/what you wish.
@StoneColdChik the panthers are advocating the killing of police, SCOTUS says that "true threats are outside the 1st Amendment so why aren't
How does Sarah Palin stay so tan when she lives in a state that does not see sun 50% of the year?
@realDonaldTrump  Disappointed on your comment on SCOTUS using the 14th amend to void MILLIONS of legal votes by state citizens. Sad USA
I told someone about how I once sat on the floor of my hotel room and watched Seinfeld for hours and they threatened to punch me.
The SCOTUS claimed under the 14th amendment they could make the same sex marriage ruling. No matter how far you stretch it isn't there.
6th circuit &amp; SCOTUS denied #KimDavis appeals &amp; upheld Bunnings order, what the heck makes her crappy lawyer think they'll do something now?
Sarah Palin says immigrants to the US should 'speak American'.  Just think: she could have been the Vice President  http://t.co/IB1P4umes0
Suggestion - get familiar with 1ST Amendment.  it pretty much strikes down all SCOTUS rulings regarding gay marriage, holiday celebrations
What's with this Twitter account? It's like the Seinfeld episode where they talk about themselves in the 3rd person. https://t.co/jlQIzMGtZR
@CNN - When you waste Sunday pretending Sarah Palin or her opinions are relevant you just admit that you've given up on being a news source.
@chicagotribune can u imagine if Sarah palin did this. Rex huppke would be mocking her all day! But a dem says it ... http://t.co/vDk7EZxjXk
Some low hanging Monday fruit:  "Sarah Palin says immigrants to the US should 'speak American'" http://t.co/aaKybqiLbK
Sarah Palin got French &amp; Spanish "all mixed up" in High School. She would, wouldn't she. http://t.co/PHOgLNQduR.
@amandapalmer methinks one of the things that God dumped may have hit Sarah Palin on her noggin
After ESPN did that whole documentary for Snoop Dogg son, he quit the team before his 1st game.
Italian police stopped California rapper Snoop Dogg on Friday as he prepared to board a private plane bound for... http://t.co/DH38uKpUZI
@Lrihendry @ChristieC733 what's scary is that it was only 5-4. Like our SCOTUS, Irving may flip on one vote.
I think Sarah Palin may have a health issue . I had a hyper - active thyroid and I still can't remember all of the odd things I said &amp; did.
Maybe this judge is on to something..unintended consequences to make SCOTUS listen https://t.co/MnJAX4eKpO
Snoop Dogg cancelled his performance at the fair tomorrow... Turns out he had a prior commitment for Mitch-a-Palooza.
Pls CNN why in a world u bring this idiot Sarah Palin on Sunday great news program state of the Union CNN u really fuck up my Sunday
No Snoop Dogg tomorrow,  out with illness. I was really looking forward to Snoop after classes tomorrow. It's how this day just went today..
It absolutely bothers the Liberals that SCOTUS ruled the 1st amendment applies to campaign cash as founder's intended! @cspanwj #PJNET #P2
1A: Congress can't make law preventing religious freedom, so SCOTUS interpretation unlawful  Const Trumps case law https://t.co/f4LSUd5ENR
Sarah Palin says US immigrants should 'speak American' http://t.co/mQQ4Vk6CVs &lt; Errrr she means English right?
#KimDavis appealed Bunnings original order and both the 6th circuit and SCOTUS denied the appeals   Why does she think it'll change now?
Young Buck may face five years in prison due to smoking marijuana with Snoop Dogg http://t.co/CYG7x2hKYG
@Petapup1 @S3nt13ntB31ng @SaculSacul won't  be the 1st time SCOTUS violated the Constitution &amp; won't be the last.
Sarah Palin says US immigrants should speak "american", does she mean Navajo or Sioux? http://t.co/SLfVeoMb6C
SCOTUS cannot make law only rule on it. Get real America.  Unless it's healthcare.Then they feel they can.    https://t.co/IyMH2Hbe09
@tedcruz our 14th amendment is also under attack, which one do we chose? oh yeah it's up to SCOTUS and they ruled!
Today, Republicans will talk about how much they appreciate workers.  Tomorrow they'll work to crush worker rights. #LaborDay sarah palin
@GDouque I may have to unfollow you for spelling Snoop Dogg with only one G
Imagine how deprived we'd be without the Sunday morning shows sharing with us the wisdom of Sarah Palin and Dick Cheney. #p2 #topprog
@Yowan @EyeAmSMF  However, I don't think today's SCOTUS and Fed Govt would interpret the 9th that way.  9th &amp;10th have seemingly disappeared
@MJosephSheppard Never said that the Dems weren't mistake-prone. Sarah Palin is just PATIENT ZERO for THE STUPID. In her defense GBW was 1st
Watching Sarah Palin telling people to speak "American" was the highlight of my Sunday. That was some classic self destruction.
May or may not have twisted my ankle reenacting Serena vs. Venus with my roommate last night.
@PoliticalLaughs @kesgardner Besides I don't believe that SCOTUS has the power to overturn state marriage laws per the 10th amendment
@daxgyetmhanaak people wholeheartedly believing satire about Sarah Palin is what got her the reputation she has in the 1st place.
@israel4911 @Letha_Hughes It was the 14th that SCOTUS ruled was being violated in blocking marriage equality. News not your strong subject.
@CNNSotu @SarahPalinUSA  Sarah Palin may be a stupid cow  -- but she is our stupid cow. We love her
Fantastic! Sarah Palin demands that migrants to USA 'speak American'. Can't make this stuff up. http://t.co/rxPfEubTiW
@FixTheCourt  Judge rules that he can NOT issue a divorce for Same Sex Couple because of SCOTUS decision.   http://t.co/kDs59JaHD5
Made my morning coffee and sat down to watch the news...Sarah Palin is on.     What a horrible way to start the day.
My gods, Sarah Palin is genuinely crazy, isn't she...    http://t.co/19YKe4lzTr
SCOTUS Apparently is Saying That Gays Have an Equal Right to Marriage Under the 14th Amendment.
Tina Fey may look like Sarah Palin but she sure as hell has a lot more going on in the brain region #Bossypants http://t.co/tPIb50u0UQ
@jspoupart @JoeC1776 no. Congress makes laws and the SCOTUS settles disputes. In this case, the 1st Amendment lost.
How is sarah Palin still in politics. She was and still is the embarrassment of the Gop, but she may be out done by some douche &amp; his toupee
@LarryOConnor @GretchenCarlson U sound like the hated "smartset" now? Is #KimDavis the 1st to ignore unlawful ruling from SCOTUS in history?
