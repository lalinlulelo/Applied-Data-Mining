(Which is why Kim lost with the 6th Circuit and SCOTUS) https://t.co/Po3u10Djn8
I'm pretty sure Serena ripped that match winning ace the same time USMNT game up their 3rd.
@ColinCowherd @Mi_Crawford     I also thought Seinfeld episode for the hair but I'm going with 6th grade class photo.
#politics  Dark side of the secret ballot?  Donald Trump and Sarah Palin may win big by going nativist   https://t.co/yASAs8BL5R via @TNH_News
@GeoConservative @peltier_maggie and SCOTUS ruled any law outlawing same sex marriage is unconstitutional for violating the 14th
@GuyScott33 14TH AMENDMENT guarantees EQUAL PROTECTION so yeah. Oh &amp;, P.S., no, SCOTUS didn't write the law but DID correctly interpret it.
C'mon now the only black person on Seinfeld was the lawyer who was supposed to be an imitation of Cochrane https://t.co/ZCjNFyouJz
Remember on Seinfeld when Kramer got fired from job they never hired him for in the 1st place? Anyways enuf abt white ppl's advice for #BLM
Gonna watch Seinfeld, smoke a joint, and pass the hell out before going back to work at 2 jobs again tomorrow. #adultshit
So like, he missed Seinfeld and Friends? And to think I was really starting to like this dude.  https://t.co/sxS4SGOGSk
Anybody asking what law #KimDavis broke needs to sit in on a 5th grade social studies class and learn the role of SCOTUS.
Stay up late, watch Seinfeld, make Steve drive tomorrow.
@MauriceBear21 she may beat Steffi or Serena's Open Era Record of titles, who knows at this point.
@Pqlyur1 SCOTUS interprets laws, and since by their interpretation it is protected by the 14th amendment it is technically a const violation
@DeepSouthProud @bryanbleano @DynaMoChen the States ensured SCOTUS could take this action by enacting 14th Amendment
@JSException @FoxNews  You may be right. However, Lincoln didn't listen to the SCOTUS when they said black people were not humans.
@Israeli_Queen You are aware that SCOTUS said that it fell under two sections of the 14th Admendment right?
@scrowder What if SCOTUS says 2nd amendment arms don't mean guns and elected official disregards it?
Sarah Palin may want us to speak American, but if she is in President Trump's cabinet many of us will be speaking Canadian.  Andy Borowitz
World, I think it may be time to accept that nothing Larry David did after Seinfeld has been funny.
Religious freedom, purposely protected by 1st A., is now trampled by the SCOTUS decision on gay marriage.#ImWithKim http://t.co/uarVbr8BE3
@alphainparis 14th Amendment is the one used by SCOTUS in the marriage equality ruling. @gshevlin
@solemnoathbeer @TheBruery To paraphrase Seinfeld: are you going to double dip?  This pic (of wax cover) looks much different than 1st pic.
.@JTSoutherland What the 14th says or doesn't say is not up to you. The words have meanings. Legally, SCOTUS decides. They have.

@npallitto @TheFive ?Regardless of your position,protocol should be followed in all SCOTUS decisions.Next time it may be one you don't like
@aquapub I know I'm stupid but it seems SCOTUS has established marriage as a right via 14th. Kim was denying people who legally qualified.
Serena defeat Venus again only this time Venus put up a fight and made to a 3rd set unlike last time i saw it #usopen
I'm finding my life and the dialogue around me are right out of a Seinfeld episode. Many of you may think this is fun, but it's unnerving.
@Billd111 @megynkelly @tedcruz SCOTUS has determined that the 14th amendment guarantees equal access to marriage for all citizens
Serena has no mercy for her sister . 6-3 on the 3rd set and match #USOpen
Will watch old movies, Seinfeld and other silly things till Sunday...the old #katrina news footage is too much for this heart to bear.
Stuck in the lodge with Jim the dads army loving sound guy who claims Seinfeld and Friends are the worst shows of all time. I may knife him.
Sarah Palin to join Donald Trump and Ted Cruz at big rally in D.C. on Wednesday, 1:00 PM at the Capitol, to protest Obama's Iran nuke deal!

@count_01 SCOTUS based their argument on the 14th. No matter how you stretch it race was not involved.
@LizSchmidt3 SCOTUS determined that to be the 14th amendment's due process clause and equal protection clauses. #Oberfeige #readityourself
@BryanCranston aren't you that dentist from Seinfeld. Have you been in anything else I may have seen?
@pnkust @USSupremeCourt Here, this will explain SCOTUS decision on SS marriage as it applied it to 14th Amend.  http://t.co/WqHlbCq9wS
@jellybean1398 watching the last episode 1st is why I skipped watching Seinfeld for MANY yrs. The 1st few yrs at least of Mad Men were good.
@HarveyAraton I may be the only human being in America never watched Seinfeld once, ditto, Friends, all those sitcoms. Only TV for sports.

@TSN1200 @TSNHammer @TSNJR @TSNSteve Web Poll Question for tmo.  Did Serena tank the 2nd set for dramatic effect against Venus? #conspiracy
So, the 27th chapter of Serena vs. Venus sees the younger Williams move within 2 wins of a #SWeep15, though it took 3 sets to do it. #USOpen
Azarenka vs Halep... I believe the person who may give Serena a hard time will come from this match.

@Kevo3k def not. She made a slight run in the 3rd but serena was up too much already

@Calila1988 Serena looked like she wanted to cry majority of the 3rd set.
