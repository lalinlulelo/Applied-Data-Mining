Tonight's episode of Monday Night Raw was lit af, the Dudley boys,Ric Flair, and Sting!! Like yo wth!
Thursday night Must-See TV hasn't been this comical since the Friends &amp; Seinfeld one-two punch. #GOPDebate
All I see is the Seinfeld logo.  https://t.co/vtIOqt0oVV
@ouij my mother baby sat Ric Flair. #woo my brush with fame.
@LaurenceWHolmes What do you mean, Laurence? The Dudleys, Ric Flair, and Sting were on Raw Monday. Taker wrestled Sunday. It IS the 90s.
If @MsCharlotteWWE defeats Nikki Bella at #nightofchampions, it Should be similar to how Ric Flair beat Dusty Rhodes to win his 1st title
If Rick Perry does not win the election, he has lost nothing as he is a strong family man, and a true Christian. https://t.co/jfo2HrUnv8
22 years ago I saw Ric Flair wrestle at age 3, in the very building I'll see @MsCharlotteWWE wrestle in tomorrow night. Mindblowing!!
Personally, I like Rick Perry and appreciate what he did for Texas. But as president...dunno. He may start a war by mispronouncing something
Someone come and see Seinfeld with me in November!!!!!!
14yrs Rick Perry ran the 12th largest economy in the WORLD,left with 18bil Surplus 27Mill people &amp; created ALL of the job growth in America!
Rick Perry succeeded with 12th largest economy in the world Texas He will be a successful President for all American  http://t.co/9cx5S19nIw
@MotionToStrike New Yorkers *get* Seinfeld and the humor and setting in the same way that Texans understand Friday Night Lights
LOL. I am quit sure that isn't the future 4 Rick Perry. He is the 1 that will give us back what we lost. We need him https://t.co/oQUc4jLoaH
The what's a better show debate, Seinfeld vs Friends is one for the ages but you may be mentally incompetent if you think Friends is better.
.@marklevinshow's Friday first hour focused on the SCOTUS unconstitutional redefinition of marriage, and the case of #KimDavis.  Excellent!
@WWE Ready to see @JohnCena  win the championship for the 16th time.  Tying the legend Ric Flair
He needs to walk tomorrow, flip the bat and begin strutting like Ric Flair  https://t.co/YsoheO2W6Z
To quote Seinfeld's Kramer, Monday has a feel; Wed has a feel, and FRIDAY has a feel. Here's to feeling the first Friday of the school year!
Obama gets Iran victory, TABOR gets another black eye, &amp; Rick Perry prepares for the end. http://t.co/NnsWyecpHZ #copolitics #copols #coleg
About to watch about 15 episodes of Seinfeld till work is over, fuck 3rd shift
About to see Ant Man... I don't expect it to be as good as A Bug's Life, Antz, or Seinfeld's "the Bee Movie"... But I may BEE surprised
@A10Jim @ninaland @WoodhullSFA And that's why SCOTUS has the last word on what laws states may enact and enforce. Hence "Supreme Court."
@Jakethehater @BrandonSprague @TheDirtJohnson @TaylorADanforth Seinfeld when Kramer is lost and confused, "I'm on the corner of 1st and 1st?

@judgealexferrer I may have missed it if u posted it but what's ur take on #KimDavis situation &amp; @GovMikeHuckabee claims about SCOTUS ruling
Nothing like watching episodes of Seinfeld on a Sunday morning.Seen all but the humorous slant is different each time. Magic @JerrySeinfeld
@chrisbraly     SCOTUS never made law they interpreted it. 14th A guarantees equal rights for all Americans

Happy 60th birthday actor Wayne Knight / In Seinfeld and Third Rock from the Sun, you may sight.
I hope that when @RonFunches wins @midnight for the 16th time, Ric Flair comes out to congratulate him. Unless Jon Stewart interferes.
Rick Perry is amazing. His speech was the best hands down. #perry2016 https://t.co/97j8jIe8tE
I just took a Coach Freeze clip out of the new @HeadtoHeadRadio intro, to make room for Ric Flair. I love my job. New intro debuts tomorrow!
Better take another look at Rick Perry.  Best record in the 12th largest world economy. AAA rating. https://t.co/BGcwYhhazc

@RBPundit I really like Rick Perry,but Rubio is my strong 2nd choice,where can I read about his Immigration policy?

Awesome day in Central Park. Looking forward to Seinfeld tour and then NXT Takeover Brooklyn tomorrow  #NXTTakeOverBrooklyn #NXTBrooklyn
TBS playing "The Comeback" episode of Seinfeld (again). Should I bust out the Jerk Store line in tomorrow night's debate?
RT: U can't keep him down.. Rick Perry may not have the most money, but has the most Active Grass Roots.. http://t.co/2SRpk22FkA/s/sopK
Seinfeld may have not known it at the time. But he made the last sitcom that mattered.

Yesterday Venus and Serena Williams faced off for the 5th time in the US Open quarter finals. Here's what Serena... http://t.co/pXZ4DtepfX
I really hope that Obama attends Serena's match on Saturday...Ciara's doing the National Anthem. Give us deze ratings biches.
@kanani_lol what a waste. It even has the last man on earth, Seinfeld, South Park and Monday night raw. Hulu is awesome
Now that I've calmed down after watching Serena.... Do you realize how great tomorrow's Vika-Simona match is gonna be??
@jon_wertheim @BenRothenberg It played out like Serena took off the 2nd set. An in form Vika MIGHT make her pay. Might.
Serena won, but big sister Venus gave her the flux! Congrats to both of them for giving us a great tennis match. https://t.co/brJ29dzm2X
Interested to see what kind of ratings the U.S. Open final gets on Saturday with Serena presumably going for history up against CFB.
Couldn't hang on to stay up and watch 3rd set but it was nice to see Serena beat Venus. What a resilient, tough player Venus is, tho.
This may be hard to believe: I am watching Seinfeld's "The Contest" for the very first time.
@900amWURD @WURD_SRenee Thankfully @KendoKennyL and I will be going to the USOpen Finals this Sat prayerfully to see Serena make history
@Alisha12287 I live 5 minutes from there. In fact my dads company is a sponsored company for it. I'm seeing Snoop Dogg there on Saturday :)
Happy for Serena. I want her to win the 22nd GS, tie Steffi and win the CYGS. @usopen #usopen
I have heard it said that the 2nd G in Snoop Dogg represents extra gangsterishness, for how else do you explain this particular redundancy?
"@SportsCenter: Serena remains on top! The younger Williams bts Venus in the sisters' 14th GS matchup, 6-2, 1-6, 6-3. http://t.co/Bl2LdYsQ9c

Love that Seinfeld episode in the picture https://t.co/BzTPPLzAeB
@NerdyWonka @terri_georgia My feeling Serena could win 2 straight set, but as a respect2 Venus and viewers she let Venus 2win 2nd set
Serena beat her sister Venus in the quarter finals.She is 2 matches away to the 4th successive Grand Slam in a row #USOpen2015
Snoop Dogg headlines Tribal Sessions tomorrow and he will be bringing some old school Hip Hop and summers vibes... http://t.co/KOIhjQxiNG
@DSmithScenes will be listening to at work tomorrow. You invoke the name of Seinfeld, I expect greatness.
Serena dominated in the end, a tough match for the win! https://t.co/QHjXSFz4Bi
Serena reaches her 7th semifinals of the #USOpen in a row. Two more matches to complete the Grand Slam.
Answer: Moi. Question: Who's seeing Serena play in the semifinals on Thursday?
Popcorn and Seinfeld sounds like the perfect friday night... #ithinkimgettingold
@nytimes Bitter /Sweet - Serena may almost not have wanted to win. BUT - their  father Richard always taught them, to do the best they can.
@NACHO2813 @Joe_Schmucc But he is shirking the gap between him and Eddie year by year. No one is catching Seinfeld, but he may catch Eddie.
@morganameridius @disquietus now back in the day I watched a good bit. Friends, Seinfeld, 3rd Rock, 70s show. But as I got older not much
I hope every young girl watched the Williams sisters tonight. Serena may have won but they'll go down as the greatest sibling duo ever!
@Omojuwa serena won her Q/final match against venus. she will play unseeded italian roberta vinci in the semis on Thursday #USOpen2015
LINK- Two Wins to Go For Serena: For the 27th time, Venus and Serena Williams stepped onto the court to dazzle... http://t.co/4D1SZ0n9pG

U.S. Open Features Familiar Matchup as Serena and Venus Williams Meet For the 27th Time http://t.co/r4PE588SoR @RealSway
Which on its surface may seem counterintuitive, but the marginal utility of Seinfeld obviously increases at an increasing rate.
George's stories may be my favorite thing about Seinfeld - he is so passionate it's wonderful
For my high schoolers : tomorrow if you get approached by anyone you don't want to talk to just tell them your ideal hangout with Snoop Dogg
Ok so Serena may have won but Venus wore hoops to the match and you know how I feel about hoops
Imagine going home before Sunday and missing Snoop Dogg hahahaha

And with Serena's 11th ace she wins the match vs her sister Venus
@TheBestMicah Hulu you say? This and Seinfeld alone may be worth reactivating my subscription
Won't be live tweeting the vma's tonight despite what you may have guessed. Watching Seinfeld instead. Thank you.

@Msldemarco you wanna drink some beers and chat about Seinfeld in Bristol on Tuesday? Yeh. Sweet.
@katetscott Best moment on air Tue.: GR " you look down on me because I don't smoke. KS "Yeah" "C'mon Gary you and me 420 and watch Serena"
Venus was serving and passing better, but she donated some UFEs in the 3rd set. Serena played the big points better for the win. #USOpen2015
@sigridellis I may have read that in the way that Seinfeld greeted Newman.
