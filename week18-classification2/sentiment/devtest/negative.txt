@EE  claims they can't do anything but upgrade at my own cost. 1st month with them - should have stayed with T-Mobile contract. #AvoidEE
Tiger Woods is the biggest tease of the entire weekend. In contention and blows it on Sunday. Next step play 72 holes instead of 54.
And in comes Sony with the letdown. Only one color. Clap it up... low and slow https://t.co/6jaRCgfvTP

@thorharris666 or "happy Monday" or "TGIF" or... How about we all just shut the fuck up for a bit? The animals will appreciate it.
@adamploski @sprint my texts arent working again...for the 2nd day in a row... c'mon #Sprint ! U got me feeling like a T-Mobile customer :-\
When you remember that tomorrow is monday but teen wolf isn't on
@The_CrapGamer Sony don't care about their exclusives they never made a theme console for their exclusives https://t.co/ft9VpAxSjs
If you're having a good day just remember that Teen Wolf isn't on tomorrow.
@GCTigerTracker - ONCE AGAIN TIGER WOODS SHITS THE DAMN BED ON A  SATURDAY, SUNDAY OR BOTH (which BOTH is what it is most of the time)
Monday's ain't the same without teen wolf
That moment when Taylor swift is here tomorrow and I'm not going ...
Oh just realized that there was no teen wolf today :((((((((( MAJOR MISSING :(((( January'16. &lt;&lt; SO LONGGGGG
C'mon, Vince...we're not stupid.  We all know Sting's going to job to Rollins to make him look strong.

#ForceFriday as a whole was pretty disappointing. Not sure who dropped the ball - retailers, Hasbro, or Disney. It's Star Wars! C'mon!
I'm here watching golf hoping Tiger Woods can do well and this ass hole Triple bogey the 11th hole!!!
Exactly why I'll never buy Sony. Those 1st class ass kissers are dick pulling the media for high scores on future games. LOL. @tomwarren

Wow Tiger Woods is SHANKING his way through the 4th round!  Can't handle the pressure.
k so i just finished watching the 5th season of Teen Wolf and i've got a few questions 1) WTF WAS THAT 2) WHY TF IS THEO STILL ALIVE
Ted 2 was a disappointment considering how much i loved the 1st. The Gollum part was hilarious though

Yesterday was lastweek,and TGIF was two days ago,which was also last week, so how the hell is tomorrow monday?

I got no love for Sony. They can disappear tomorrow,someone else would just replace them and try harder for consumers. @Gaming_forever1
Seriously don't want a phone anymore. Calling T-Mobile tomorrow to cancel this shit
Sad moment when you realize tomorrow is Monday and there's no new episode of Teen Wolf so no Moonday bummer
@JohnLegere my T-mobile experience has been he'll since I switched in April... Do you care? I have to call every month... #tmobilesucks
@KingConcha @lil_kekev @allysonbonilla_ know she definitely doesn't wanna see Ted 2 tomorrow cuz u stupid
Sony rewards app is like a lot of 19 y.o female singers and a non retro sale. 2nd one with no info
Everyone should most definitely not go watch Star Wars on December 18th because it'll be a terrible movie
this bitch said "TGIF" and it's Monday...
@strunk_daddy For any info you would need to contact Sony. Apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused ^AI

Teen wolf season 5 just premiered but where is it tomorrow     Oh yeah    Not here
@greetmytweet_ hahah I haven't had one since Monday, and it was supposed to be expedited here. T-Mobile is a joke.
Tiger woods just ruined Sunday for America.
TGIF is totally meaningless when you have to work on Saturday..just sayin;)#PSYBringItOn
Everyone's like TGIF!   And I'm over here like I work tonight.  And a double tomorrow.  And Sunday.  And monday.   #grindin #needmoney
Guy at T-mobile: ok so just call the store tomorrow and ask for me so we can set up the phone!  Me the next day: what the fuck was his name.
@bollybrit @itsnacool both of webb ones made less money than the 3rd Raimi one, plus the success of Marvel had Sony scared i think
TGIF but even tho it's Friday I'm not happy
Still waiting for my phone to come back from Sony..bit lost without it. Hopefully back up by Thursday. Last upload was from my PC.
#Billsmafia I'm just saying,  Today the 1st team Offense had no Harvin, Watkins, McCoy... T-mobile with the crew is just damn scary
Tomorrow anti Iran  show : Beck the crazy messianic nut job, Trump the fascist reality show fascist. Panderer Cruz and quitter Palin. Wow
Theresa May, in her desire to win over the dunderheads who vote in Tory leadership elections, really does personify the Stupid Party.
@neon_shadows I said nothing of the sort. I support the 2nd amendment. Trump wants to ban assault weapons. I don't.
Why many conservative pundits   R declaring war on Trump. Dec-  laring war on the most candid &amp;   'for the people' candidate in   YOUR lifetime!

This may be our last chance to see Zlatan in the World Cup and FIFA totally fucked it up. Shocker.
Watching a replay of the PSG / Lille match from Friday. No Zlatan makes PSG unwatchable.
So, about Zlatan... I don't want him. All reports are that he's not a good teammate. He'd be our 3rd DP Fwd, how do you work the 3 together?
