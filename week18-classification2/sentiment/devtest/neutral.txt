@GrkStav Tsipras Plan A was stall until politics improved. May have miscalculated and thought it would improve by June 30.
Tsipras resigns like a martyr. Blames Troika for driving Greece to the edge. But it is Tsipras that may have pushed Greece over it.

4 Of course, Tsipras may not need these 3 parties. He may get overall majority (unlikely) or be able to rule with ANEL (not very likely)
Electoral Commission will decide which is the official 'NO' campaign and it may not be UKIP's #brexit #eu #euref
Apparently, I wrote an article thingy about Valentine's to post on the 14th of Feb but completely forgot about it. Cool.

Having Xbox downloadable games always release on Wed. was such a smart move. Now, it's chaos. No idea what's out or when.
@LiLHammy97 we may have the slimmest of chances cuz of De Gea. But not enough time rather try for Griezmann. Wont mind Zlatan for a year !
LOL Aulas still mad about the penalty Zlatan took a 2nd time a few month ago. I'm delighted by the fact that he is still butt-hurt about it!

@Keith_Russell I don't want it to be but it may be Austin. Obviously prefer Zlatan, muller, Lewandowski etc #mufc
@Jon_LeGossip Thoughts about the aubameyang rumors? Cover if Zlatan leaves? Or adding depth? Augustin a good 3rd Striker for UCL quality?
WORLD HAS ABANDONED THE SYSTEM.    This is now centrally commanded just like Playstation or Xbox. https://t.co/KsUFmf5oLJ
One word from Zlatan and he will keep quiet  "@Crhedrys Lmaoooooo Hazard 3rd best? Make Zlatan catch Mourinho fes."
Welp, this is it... I am upgrading to Windows 10. I may make the dumbest decision in terms of computers. Who knows? http://t.co/pg4QX3tgpp
I tried the Xbox One preview....couldn't figure out how to fly. https://t.co/xcZqNO16Yr
@MrTransferNewss @FootbaIISources considering I'm 31st, it looks like Zlatan's about to disappear.
@orangejunkie it may work cause it keeps un syncing from the Xbox one
We held talks with PSG on Thursday for Zlatan name now confirmed to me but this is two days old news

@Blay_Vision the mics are rubbish!!  Xbox need to produce better mics, luckily my spare pad has the 2nd headset port
@SambahawkBW @beano160 Windows 10 may have done it, but that was just your computer so it shouldn't stop others from upgrading.
.@DIRECTVService Still waiting for an answer regarding the Sunday Ticket app for Xbox One. I bought the package just to use on Xbox.
think I've come to the point in my life where I need to purchase an Xbox and reignite my 8th prestige black ops side
@Battlefield quick question. Is Battlefield 3 going to be available for backwards compatibility on Xbox one this November?
Ibra recovery time is still unknown, the French League starts on Friday. PSG will play Lille, Zlatan is very much in doubt for that.
@ash_purnell96 how you getting it on 15th and don't say changing your time zone on Xbox with ea access hahaha

@JETSxMUNOZ I'll explain tomorrow son but basically shorty sold my Xbox, not to mention all my games but just know we back &amp; she'll get hers
@YouAreMyArsenal Wouldn't surprise me if we enquired.He can't be 100% happy playing 2nd fiddle to Zlatan but he's not worth PSG asking price
Rib injury for Zlatan against Russia is a big blow if he misses Austria game Tuesday. A chance for new Sunderland striker Toivonen #SAFC
@RossoneriBlog oh c'mon, you all know exactly what i meant. I never said Zlatan should be benched in 1st place. It's about possibilities.
2nd day in a row @SmiteGame isn't giving me xp on Xbox...maybe take a second away from your steam launch and fix what's already out?
@Jon_LeGossip Any truth to Galatasaray having made an informal offer to PSG for Zlatan? Is he fit to play this Sunday?
@teft if your on Xbox playing some rift tomorrow do you think I can join plz plz
@nananavy That &amp; Zlatan insisting on playing through pain for the 2nd half vs. Lyon. Why not just come off? 2-0 up anyway.
@_mindy_ @RetroUnited coz of Zlatan talking how he loves a fight. May make him show LVG just how he is truly world class.
replace Zlatan with Harry Kane on 8 Aug.. #Doomed  https://t.co/jwZ5gSASRG
Sat down to play Xbox, remembers I have to make lunch for tomorrow. Lousy adulthood Interfering with with my mindless entertainment.

@xboxsupport1 may not be relevant but I am also an Xbox preview memeber with which we have had a couple of mysterious updates recently
Can't even start the update till tomorrow can't even play my Xbox till tomorrow because of the movers
@Be2happyHappy Sorry for any delay, you may want to bring any abusive language to the attention of Xbox support. ^TO
If Wenger is in Paris. Could it be for Cavani or Zlatan?Then again he may be on a family break.
@xL3GND following and added on xbox may i get an invite when ur on if you have room thanks in advance GT - Eptic Wolf
@Jon_LeGossip I didn't think they will sell either. Maybe Rabiot but surely Cavani doesn't want to play 2nd fiddle to Zlatan anymore
Zlatan is looking mighty attractive at the moment,if LVG doesn't get a striker by Tuesday, I really don't fancy us scoring goals this season
