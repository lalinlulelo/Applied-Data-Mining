Theresa May is laying down a marker for the Tory leadership. Tough on immigration and tough on the causes of immigration.

So much Tom Cruise in my eyeballs tonight. But the dude made some good choices. Edge of Tomorrow? Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation? GOOD
I still can't believe Tom Cruise from Top Gun Is coming to our school Friday for USA day!!!

Tom Cruise was 24 when he was in Top Gun. Meanwhile, I just laughed at a fart joke and don't want to go to work tomorrow morning.
Can't wait for golf tomorrow #group1 psyche rocking out in  the 3rd group . I'm worse than the new tiger woods

Roll on September 12th!  The destruction of the Left as an electoral force creates the space for UKIP
@freedmanhp4 @JohnRentoul @lordbonkers May be good news for UKIP too though Corbyn is the most Eurosceptic leader since Michael Foot.
@Hugodixon I would say Oct are early elections. If Tsipras doesn't hold them then, he will go the way of PASOK &amp; Samaras when held later.
