If GMB goes after Boko Haram with the same passion he went after Dasuki,the 50+ victims of the Yobe bomb blast on Friday will still be alive

After 75 today maybe I was wrong about Dustin Johnson getting over US Open collapse. Terrible 3rd RD #OpenChampionship
Road accident is the 2nd highest source of violent death after Boko Haram in Nigeria.Yet,no data to warn citizens @BudgITng #DATARevolution

Not a great start for the amateur Paul Dunne. Imagine having to compose yourself to hit your third ball (5th shot) off the tee on hole 2!
Then you add in the guilt factor. Did Harper Lee really want Watchman published? If her 1st draft has been hijacked I'd feel bad reading it.
@KellyTilghmanGC   After the 2nd round, you did your usual melodramatic spew that Dustin Johnson was in a class of his own. Same old garbage.
It's Sunday, Miss USA is on and all y'all want to tweet about are dicks.

By Joe Hemba DAMATURU, Nigeria, July 10 (Reuters) - Boko Haram islamist militants attacked the northern Nigerian town of Buni Yadi in Yobe
R&amp;A's handling of the end of round 2 was diabolical. I watched Spieth, Matsuyama and Dustin Johnson early Saturday, very unfair on them.
@bieberscinema @SpikeLSB Who's Deion? That may be worse than the Paul McCartney thing
Just gonna say it: The lyrics in "Bad Blood" sound like they were written by a 7th grader. "Done" doesn't have two syllables, Taylor.
Still can't believe Ryan Braun and Jew Unit were able to beat the 1st test on technicality that his piss was mishandled!
Boko Haram are so evil. Even on this sacred day for all muslims, they are carrying out bombings. May the hottest part in hell be for them
Floyd Mayweather should  buy 1st row for all who beat the hell out of Berto, Berto should buy 1st row for the judge who sent Floyd to jail.

Why Yakub is so scared of death, when he is sure of getting 72 virgins tomorrow? Why Siculars are denying Allah's guaranteed reward? Sad.
Watched Paper Towns on Saturday and I'm still very disappointed with the movie
Pranab Mukherjee has just again rejected Yakub's 2nd mercy petition, hanging would be on as per schedule at 7am tomorrow #HangYakubNow .
Yakub may or may not hav deseved death but he definitely deservd life imprisonment 4his deeds.Shame on those who are painting him as a saint
All those who petitioned for stopping Yakub's hanging , may hang themselves ...This would be the best  "Shraddhanjali" to him
And even after all the petitions, all the hearings, someone will say tomorrow that Yakub didn't get a fair trial.
The Zoo miniseries may be the worst collection of images &amp; sounds man has ever produced. We're talking Sharknado w/o the self-awareness.
Ant-Man tomorrow. Looking forward to it, but some asshole ruined it for me.
Sorry gang, 2nd Act of Ant-Man just kills my buzz. SO BORING and the writing is REALLY bad. I'm hoping this stuff wasn't in Wright's script.
Lakh of cases R pending in supreme court even than Yakub's case being heard 6/7th time today as if there no work in court.public want answer
That's one sex tape I hope to NEVER see!  Is Hulk Hogan a racist? Find out what @PeachesNCreamSF has to say about it http://t.co/1Bv5hkss8I
Yakub financed the blasts and died but his brother did not care enough for him.  Tiger did not come and surrender  t http://t.co/yEH9cZFBGi
#YakubToHang Matter of fate; Yakub to be hanged tomorrow on his b'day. Apart 4rm all v sud nt forget dat he is being paid off 4 his sins.
Chuck Norris was born of the Greek gods Ares and Hermes in a grand session of buttsecks that may never be equaled.
You mean I have wait until SHARKNADO 4 to know what happened to April?! This is bullcrap! Bullcrap I tell you! Ahhhh!!! #Sharknado3
Dr. going to see lot of people of stomach pain due to yakub's hanging tomorrow @abhijeetsinger @sardesairajdeep @MrsGandhi @smitaprakash
@sebpatrick I'm seeing Ant-Man tomorrow. If it has an ant called Antony, and that ant dies, if this is a spoiler, I will be so mad at you.
@flipkartsupport are you kidding me? I want to replace my old phone with Moto G 3rd Gen at any cost. Do anything. It's not my fault.
But it's nothing that 257 families lost their family members because of Yakub.  https://t.co/U8A37eWphV

News channels should stop telecasting the Yakub's news. It may lead 2 communal disturbance. Rather they can cover Abdul Kalam's last journey
One may argue if hanging Yakub was right or wrong. But the people who are trying to portray him as a communal hero are purely anti-national
Yakub death may be unfortunate bt we shud respect SC's decision n not vitiate atmosphere in the name of religion #YakubToHang #YakubVerdict
@5Forty3 the way MSM and leftists are crying for Yakub, ppl may mistake him as some son-of-soil patriot sacrificing himself for nation
@brownbrumby Agree with 2nd part,but Yakub is no reason. Best logical argument against his hanging by @Raghav_Bahl. @YRDeshmukh @asadowaisi
Reason why Ant-Man may have 'struggled' vs. other Marvel? My parents assumed it was a parody.
@tajinderbagga No issues if he is saving an innocent of any religion, but Yakub killed hundreds of innocent, tomo Bhushan may back ISIS too!
Yakub meman     Going to hang the credibility of Indian judiciary tomorrow. Rules for mercy and humqnity not for rope.
All stoned with weed march to Jantar Mantar. LOL. Y don't @kavita_krishnan volunteer to be hanged instead of Yakub? https://t.co/BgAc4fZYZG
You can't escape the truth by closing eyes.    If not Yakub today, something else tomorrow;they will be like this only https://t.co/MtZycRuAwa
They may have ditched Hulk Hogan but the WWE still stink: http://t.co/F2SQ5ADNtd http://t.co/Kz1up2mlvC
I don't have Faith on  constitution.Sorry to Yakub's family.. May God bless Yakub's soul with rest and peace in heaven.Hang rapist first..

Live:Supreme Court approved the death warrant,Yakub will be hanged tomorrow at 7 am in Nagpur Jail@PranabMukherjee@PMNarendraModi
@SappyReDevil Yakub has to be hanged and he will definitely be hanged at 7 am tomorrow morning. Birthday = death day.
One of the son of neighbor lawyer even said "these blood thirsty people will hang Yakub tomorrow" - Last Night
@D_J_Harvey I think they may want a guy with back problems. Here, have Ryan Braun!
Spare me the nuances, Yakub is certainly not innocent. Rarest of the rare case? May be! #YakubToHang

The most conclusive argument against the bleeding hearts and why logic doesn't hold for them in Yakub's hanging. https://t.co/RrlAj1K9aN
Actually today was Yakub's birthday. I wish him many many returns of this day. May he hang in hell too.!!
Tomorrow they will discuss #YakubHanged after their Friday prayer. Bad part is 100s of youth will get inspired to be the next Yakub.
Yakub meets destiny chosen by himself. For the killers waiting may be longer the destination will be the same!!!!
Yakub is hanged.Y d cry!!Y d nonsense over his religion.Whtevr religion he may belong 2,he ws a terrorist n thts all 1 needs 2 c n undrstnd
I think aftr seeing all this #YakubToHang drama, the security guy at d jail would like to shoot Yakub dead rather than hanging him tomorrow
@NeelakshiGswm @kavita_krishnan Kaash  she will commit suicide if yakub will be hanged tomorrow '' DOUBLE BONUS" wow
Yakub's hanging may have created a fear in the minds of the terrorists, but it hasn't created any difference in our country
Very bad idea 2 allow the dead body of Yakub to come to Mumbai-situation may become evn more tense @Dev_Fadnavis @HMOIndia @BJPRajnathSingh
@ndtv Y don't u ask ur reporters to collect pottys of Yakub menon so tomorrow you can sell it as Secular fertiliser..rubbish reporting shame
I think Tushar Gandhi should hang himself to protest against hanging of Yakub.And yes it should be on 29th just day B4 30th #yakubdebate
Why is Stone Cold on the cover of #WWE2K16? He's hardly ever on anymore. Seth Rollins would be better. This may declare a no buy for me!
If something wrong happen tomorrow due to Yakub death sentence, media should be blame for it. They r making it more sensitive. #YakubToHang

@arunvipra @mediacrooks @_sabanaqvi is wrong: Dr APJ the ex-President passed on July 27; Yakub the terrorist was hanged till death on Jul 30
@TimesOfIndia btw how much money you charged from "eminent people" to make Yakub's headline a prominent one ??? https://t.co/z586zvUrsA
@ShekharGupta Media did sympathize with Yakub n help in producing many young Yakubs in India. But you guys claim u r 4th pillar.bloody shame
@RajivMessage Was this media mafia behind the fact that Yakub got front page coverage when Lt respected Kalam was on 3rd or even 5th page
Nirvana was scheduled to headline Lollapalooza in 1994 but dropped out on April 7th. Kurt Cobain's dead body was found the next day.

@TaxonomyCat It's clearly a trap. In fact suspect it may have been prentis who emailed out pretending to be George Osborne.
The march of ISIS seems to have begun in India with Yakub's funeral. They want to wave off murder of 257 on mere repentance?
@bomani_jones the same Rousey fans tht scream Money May doesn't fight anyone, be the first to make an excuse as to why Rousey won't move up

Rangers LF Josh Hamilton was out again with a sore left knee, and he'll have an MRI on Friday.  #Rangers
David Price does not look happy getting sent off. He's allowed a hit each inning and left the game with the tying run at 2nd.
You'd assume the Mets would love to have David Wright back by next weekend in Colorado, worst case scenario Monday in Philadelphia.

Wendy Williams sat there and literally made transphobic comments about Caitlyn Jenner and yet you don't see anything wrong??
@Chris__Shield @kizrees at least Dustin Johnson knows how to party which is why I'm guessing he falls apart by Sunday after his weekend out
The Weeknd is releasing on the 28th but I can't even be excited because Frank Ocean ruined the whole getting excited for an album thing.

If Steve or Johnny Mac get evicted I may be done with this season of Big Brother. I can't stand James or Vanessa either. #BigBrother17
@rahulkanwal @PMOIndia It will happen in 4th year and remember Rahul don't make him hero like u guys did with yakub
This may sound sad but I've gotten so used to not having David Wright play w/the #nymets that im ok if he doesn't return.
@XoticCherry 1st Gucci is wack and his last good song was "My Kitchen"  2nd Future is trash af and don't nobody know what he be saying lmao
@ChaoticRollins The first and the Last crap on this planet right is you Seth Rollins and on Sunday WWE Universe will get rid of this "CRAP".
Why is rolling stone putting Donald trump on the cover? I may have to cancel my subscription.
Everybody better hide tomorrow. If Brock Lesnar is there he will fuck shit up again. No one is safe lol
Why does Big Brother still exist? Well, it's on Channel 5, which some may consider a fate worse than cancellation.
Kane might just be going thru that 2nd season syndrome
School starts tomorrow and I'm still sad AF about Zayn, Louis is a dad and now this tf #OneDirection
@MMAFighting @davedoylemma No she was not robbed. She will NEVER beat Rousey and Nobody is interested in watching her lose for the 3rd time
Caitlyn Jenner is accused of manslaughter in a crash during the Bruce era. Police may call it off after trouble locating a Bruce Jenner.
Big Brother is actually painful. Can it please be Thursday already?
Jon Stewart cheating he helps Seth Rollins win that some cheap Monday Night Raw comes on tomorrow and I'm not going to be happy

I'm sorry, but Randy Orton is the most plain wrestler on the roster. He does nothing for me in the main event spot. 2nd is Sheamus.

@WWENetwork After watching John Cena's match m really disappointed with this 3rd class system of wwe in summer slam..just like bull shit
If I wake up tomorrow and Seth Rollins is still the champ I will be so pissed off
The graves are full with people who thought they would practise islam when older not even everyone is promised tomorrow #Realtalk
I'm going to be quietly singing "John Cena sucks! John Cena sucks!" to myself for most of tomorrow. Well done, #SummerSlam crowd.
1st Scott Walker dismissed #BlackLivesMatter then he dismissed Muslims  Is he being self destructive or preparing his Exit Speech? #ByeWalker

#KimDavis if u gave as much thought to your own marriage as u do to gay marriage,  you wouldn't be on your 4th marriage now.
Who cares what an asshole like snoop dog who barely speaking englisg said about Tom Brady #bradywins will take care business thursday
I am thinking these initial reviews of the new Iron Maiden album may be prone to a bit of hyperbole.
Tom Brady seriously said "...to a large degree, we have all lost." C'mon man!  Can you not even briefly pretend not to be a huge douche?

It sucks that I'm not even excited for the #SPECTRE theme tune debuting tomorrow, if it is Sam Smith it will really dampen my excitement.

June 7-8 Red Sox at Giants. Who's down to go and boo from the 3rd baseline?

Murray a set down and 3-0 down in the 2nd set and bookies are laying Murray at Evens? Ridiculous
Murray can't be happy with that tie-break esp. What did he need to do better this match? #usopen https://t.co/aThIQd6RlI

@MadDogUnleashed be honest, if Ventura had thrown 1st pitch like Thor you all would be blasting him instead drooling on yourself? #Royals
Lol, get a grip #royals fans. I can forgive the HRs, but he biffed that pitch to Thor and then fell apart in the 4th https://t.co/5vyHq69IQn
Curtis is right: #SJSharks forwards coasting back to the D zone is not a formula for success. 3rd line didn't distinguish itself there.

@dubs_mike80 If Escobar was hurt I would hope you would be calling for Thor's suspension. If KC throws up tomorrow, you should have no prob

Dana White is a terrible promoter sometimes. Instead of praising Holm her for her performance, he says Rousey had a bad night? C'mon man.
I like it when a celebrity that's crap at cooking goes on Saturday Kitchen. Chris Evans looks like he's never used a whisk in his life.

This may be an unpopular opinion, but I think that ever since the Grammy's snubbed Kendrick the first time,they just throwing awards at him

If J.Cole and Kendrick Lamar don't realease something February....I'm going to be really sad.
Poor Burt he sounded in good spirits with Chris Evans on Friday but seems a broken man on Jonathan Ross!
So I sat through that for Nintendo's announcement and they didn't make one. Like, even a trailer for Twilight Princess HD would've been fine
While we're on the topic.... J. Cole &gt; Kendrick     As far as Black Friday is concerned... Go debate ya fat aunt who only wears elastic pants
