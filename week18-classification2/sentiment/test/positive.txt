July 23rd is National Hot Dog Day. Preparation and condiment styles vary regionally across the U.S., with mustard being the No.1 choice.
Today is National Hot Dog day but to me it's so much more.  It's a combo of Hanukkah, Christmas, my birthday (Sept. 1), and even 4th of July
@JackJackJohnson @jackgilinsky Omg! I can't wait Calibraska is coming out tomorrow. I can't wait, to get it.
That brawl between undertaker and Brock Lesnar was crazy last Monday on Raw I want to see more

Ant-Man feels like a rough 1st draft of the Marvel universe (namely Iron Man) which it probably was, considering it's where it all started.
@delong_sheila Disclaimer: Some music may cause high BP spikes, I showed up to my Dr Appt with a BP of 180/190 after rocking to Nirvana ;)

@michaelirvin88 We lost one of the greats today.. Frank Gifford was amazing and also had the voice that I loved on Monday night. #greatHOF
There's this scene in the 2nd season of naruto where sasuke says "what's up "and I laugh so hard every time
Thank you Frank Gifford for the many Monday Night memories.  You'll be missed https://t.co/atSN6vKDIM
RIP Frank Gifford one of the all time greatest Giants and a mainstay on Monday Night Football for years, #FrankGifford
whatcha want from Dunkin tomorrow sweetheart? @kayciiiii__
Had the chance to finally see both the Fantastic Four and Ant-Man. If I may indulge in a pun... Big things do come from small packages.
The Monday Night Football song will always feature "Frank and Al and Dan" to me. Thanks for the memories, Frank Gifford.
@LesleyCBS3 @PatGallenCBS3 Happy Sunday. I hope all is well. Question: Do you find it as eerie as I do Frank Gifford died the same (more)
Frank Gifford who also was a great broadcaster on Monday Night Football was the perfect role for our kids regardless of where they were born
Frank Gifford was the face of Giants and original 'Monday Night' rock star http://t.co/95gxevH1eB
I know that had to be hard for Al Michaels to announce the passing of Frank Gifford. They covered a lot of games on Monday nights. #MNF #NFL
@NFL A sad, shocking day for football.  May Frank Gifford be remembered always and forever, RIP
The coolest guy in the room ... Frank Gifford ... Monday night football will always be Howard Cosell, Don Meredith and Frank #RIP16
Rest in peace Frank gifford ! my thoughts and prayers go out to @KathieLGifford  and her family! may god be with them thero this hard time!
Nailed it! BOOYAH! Greatest MNF Memory Earl Campbell 199 yds 4 TD's and the 81 TD Run! I was 9! Frank Gifford RIP! https://t.co/RfRxiQB1wA
Always enjoyed it when Frank Gifford was on Monday Night Football, especially when he was teamed with Al Michaels and Dan Dierdorf.
Nice touch by @SNFonNBC to run the music from Friday Night Lights (@nbcfnl) during their tribute to Frank Gifford. #RIP
@WWERollins @CFBelltown Seth Rollins great match with Neville on Monday night raw very entertaining match
RIP Frank Gifford. Always seemed like a class act, especially when thrust into the Monday Night Football circus that was Howard Cosell.

Shoutout to @bthousto for going with me to see Ant-Man (highly recommend) and scoring us free ice cream yesterday. Best 2nd to last day here
Watching Monday Night Football with Don Meredith - Howard Cosell and Frank Gifford was the best sportscasting of all time.
It's very impressive that Frank Gifford, who died Sunday at 84, remains the leading touchdown scorer in the history of the New York @Giants.
Sending my prayers to the family of Frank Gifford. May the strength of God comfort you during this difficult time.
Frank Gifford, Al Michaels and Dan Dierdorf are pretty much the sound of every sleepy late-night fall Monday of my childhood.
My generation learned to love the NFL every Monday night thanks to Frank Gifford. Sending all my prayers to his family  #RIPFrankGifford
Just talked to Dan Dierdorf about the death of Frank Gifford, his former Monday Night Football broadcast partner: "I wasn't expecting it."
Best play by play man Monday Night Football ever had, back when you couldn't wait for MNF to be on ! FRANK GIFFORD  RIP
RIP Frank Gifford, the original voice of Monday Night Football with Cosell and Meredith
Frank Gifford was a Giant on the field before he spent a career on Monday Night Football.  https://t.co/aTlzNMIEHQ

Dustin Johnson might be the best Thursday golfer in history. He has to finish a major on top eventually. Has immense talent.
can it be Thursday already I'm trying to watch the new Naruto episode
The 10th hole seems to be a good birdie hole. Dustin Johnson birdies the 10th, his 1st hole to move to -1 #PGAChamp
We go to the 3rd tied at one thanks to Kris Bryant's solo homer
Bloody hell, ok so in 3 days thats Mad max, Big hero 6 and Naruto: The last. Now about to watch the Lego movie, Think I may OD on good films
If you could win a golf tournament on the 1st day, then Dustin Johnson would have 9 majors by now.
@Beth_Annie315 maybe if it was our musical but ehh Sam Smith is so much more amazing c'mon Bethany
Argh! Gonna miss Friday &amp; another David Price start.. Hopefully make it back to in time to see a few innings
see that dustin johnson is a co-leader right now. will take him serious if he is in top 3 on the final 9 sunday #pgachampionship
Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina ripped Donald Trump's incendiary remarks about Megyn Kelly on Friday night.
It's the Rd 1 Dustin Johnson show rearing its head again at another major. He leads by two, but Sat and Sun will tell the tale #PGAChamp
sam I just realized I'm seeing Sam smith tomorrow I'm so in love
Dustin Johnson has a lead in a major on Thursday, because of course he does: http://t.co/ZkrnHVKwoh http://t.co/AaqEi1H4vL

Remembering how normal it was to see Ice Cube at our high school all the time     Sat right in front of him at a play too lmao
When Chuck Norris decides to wake, he makes the sun rise.  When he goes to bed, the sun sets, if it knows whats good for it.
Thank you very much Dustin Johnson. 1st round leader never in doubt!
I guess one 80s action star is much the same as any other. Can't wait for Chuck Norris's remake of Junior. https://t.co/SLIaOSUzP2

@baghdadinvest @abbasnasir59 Not just Christians, you are in the prayers of "all of us" humans.May you stay safe and be free soon!God bless.

Rolling Stone and The Zone are the best songs on Thursday
I'm really hoping Seth Rollins finds a way to win on Sunday. I don't want to see Cena reign #16. No thanks.
A very wonderful and much expected call from the Super Eagles handler Sunday Oliseh, Mikel and Moses don't deserve a call up for now.

Short drive to work this morning with Bad Blood--Raspberry Beret--Out of Style as my soundtrack.  Tuesday gonna be a good day.
yesterday ericka n I went to the hotel where sam smith was staying n sat in the lobby for a good 2 hrs n saw 2 guys that seemed "important"
@dontbackdownANM Who do you have winning this Sunday? The Undertaker or Brock Lesnar
David Wright goes down swinging on fourth AB. Had a couple nice looks. Just couldn't connect. He's at third to start the 8th. #Mets
Love or hate, Ryan Braun is playing some fantastic baseball as of late. @Brewers may be out of it, but it's not because of him. #justsaying
@KathieLGifford When I hear the words Monday Night Football I still think Frank Gifford. Thank you for sharing his testimony on the air!
i just saw last monday night raw now and @JohnCena came and made Seth Rollins and the authority shut the hell up love it #nevergiveup #wwe
Funimation's Tokyo Ghoul trailer was very strategic putting from the studio of Yu Yu Hakusho &amp; Naruto &amp; Bleach. Put the highest quality 1st
They shud've skipped all the stuff abt the Chronic &amp; Ice Cube writing Friday &amp; skipped to them bcoming cool w/ Eazy. Other stuff irrelevant
My money is on John Cena.. And Brock Lesnar... Two of the best matches you'll get to see on Sunday!!!!!!!!!!!!
Our lives as Christians may be the only Bible some people read. So it's important that as Christians we live it to the very best. Goodnight!
Sheamus is going to win on Sunday since he was pinned by Randy Orton more than once since Battleground.
Brock Lesnar on sportscenter talking about his fight with the Undertaker this Sunday.... What a time to be alive
.@FGaryGray interesting metatextual touch with Ice Cube's son delivering the "Bye Felicia" line from Friday to the girl at the party in SOC.
If you are a real MMA fan then UFC 194 will probably be the 2nd best card of the year I wouldn't put the Rousey card in the top 10
Radio just played U2's "Bad". Which rarely happens &amp; is one of my very favorite songs of all time so my day may have just peaked very early.
Friday morning special guest live in studio.  Drake White just got the opening slot on the Zac Brown Band tour... http://t.co/5W5OGtQj5O
The #ByeFelicia scene is brilliant in @ComptonMovie considering that it originated from #Friday which @FGaryGray directed and Ice Cube wrote
Happy 9th anniversary to the group that brought me to kpop! Continue slaying. #BI6BAN9 http://t.co/XJmWFlQFlj
Seth Rollins promo has been better than the first two hours of Monday Night #RAW
@chrissantos forget the yankees.. Brock Lesnar in the ring on Monday night RAW! 6 days to summer slam!
@SpandanSadhukh1 Go for Moto G 2nd Gen, amazing Phone with no bugs   http://t.co/IzGHrnYLfT Smooth performance and elegant look
#Brewers Ryan Braun went 2-for-5, left on base four times and hit his 23rd double of the season. #MLB
Well, now that Big Brother is On Demand from when it didn't record all of it on Sunday... Time to catch up. #BB17
Ice Cube may be the realest rapper alive
Gotta put the Nirvana shirts on hold until Wednesday. Guess I'll try to look decent
That was a nice nod seeing Ice Cube writing the screenplay for FRIDAY. Another movie directed by F. Gary Gray.
Been on repeat all day: Sam Smith for the win! #MusicFlow #Tuesday https://t.co/5tjfVz8npp
Haven't played ball in a while, definitely gotta go Ice Cube on a good day tomorrow at the gym.
Chuck Norris can make a hole in the sun with a snowball
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/88Zz0T7tuI Arnold Schwarzenegger and Joe Manganiello join Hulk Hogan in the ring: Raw, March 24,
My dad and sister will try out Daredevil series tomorrow. They really liked Ant-Man when I recommended it to them...    HEHEHEHEHE!
so the guy who just sat down beside me looks like Hulk Hogan from the waist up but has toothpick legs.. thanks for the let down, SpongeBob.
@CMPuLs3 He's going to beat Seth Rollins THIS SUNDAY NIGHT AT WWE SUUUPPPEEERRSLAMMM!!!
Can't wait to hear the huge pop for Brock Lesnar tonight, despite the fact that he's facing The Undertaker this Sunday. #RAW
Trying to sell my Jason Aldean ticket for this Saturday. Anyone want to go????
Just bought my "Boruto - Naruto the Movie" ticket for October 10! http://t.co/6h1KL0U4wB
I have been watching Naruto for DAYS. Help me. Save me from the 4th Great Ninja War.
Brock Lesnar on ESPN tomorrow including @MikeAndMike and Sportscenter. Glad to see the Worldwide Leader embracing the "E" in ESPN and WWE.
This may be best defense @stluciemets can put on the field. Of course it helps to have a 2x Gold Glove winner in David Wright at 3rd. #Mets
Brock Lesnar on SportsCenter tomorrow morning. Wrasslin' is going mainstream again!
I hope that John Cena wins the wwe world heavyweight champion for the 16th time &amp; Seth Rollins is right the future is now. #titlefortitle
Brock Lesnar reminds fans why he can beat The Undertaker this Sunday at @wwe SummerSlam. http://t.co/Zo2Rb4WPzF
As long as Seth Rollins leaves with his title Sunday night then I'll be happy #RAW #TitleForTitle
@JohnCena that was golden what you said to Seth Rollins on Monday Night Raw. Go Cena! 16X champion coming soon to you.
Ice Cube made his son a movie star. Now they should just do awhole new "Friday" with his son playing as him
@arlene_santana Nice I love it Arlene!! I think the good Friday movie characters Ice Cube &amp; Chris Tucker love it too! http://t.co/ztIuRx7K3w
When everyone's so excited about Lady A at the fair but you just saw The Zac Brown Band on Friday http://t.co/7cGqb9WPZ3
If Frank Ocean's next album is as good as the 2nd half of Pyramids then it's going to be a instant classic
Not even 20 pages into Paper Towns and the book centers around the night of May 5th. I know its gonna be a good one now! #cincodemayo
David Wright played all 9 innings in the field for St. Lucie. Went 0-1 with three walks at the plate. Due up 6th in bottom of the 9th. #Mets
I'm going to be so ready to go over to Christians tomorrow after school
You may be cool but you'll never be 'I share my birthday with Paul McCartney' cool like me
Seth rollins would have been a great champion if he does all things whatever he says every monday night on #raw in the middle of this ring

Its the 1st video without zayn and its still perf #DragMeDownMusicVideo

"Straight outta Compton" was so live the fact that they had Ice Cube actually rehearsing his lines for Friday ..

@Mo_S10 hoping I'm covered but the 7th race is a single in a 13 horse field haha. I've seen him win though. Iron Maiden is a good horse

My review of "Straight Out of Compton"  If you like Ice Cube, you may like his son better. plus "bye Felicia" makes even more sense B +

Dave Grohl I may not be in the cities with you singing word for word to Foo Fighters songs right now but I'm there with you in spirit.

David Wright def got his groove back on defense after a rough 1st couple games right after he returned. The Captain's looking great! #Mets

@camerondallas July 22nd so I could be with my best friend listening to Shawn again. @jackscaked
A lot has happened while I was away sprain-spraying my ankle. Murray has taken the 1st set 6-3 in 50 mins &amp; is up a break at 2-1 in the 2nd.

This Red Sox team, this one, start over in May they win the pennant and good chance at WORLD SERIES ..........GO SOX

Murray has this. He may not have it at the moment but I'm not worried #USOpen #murray

Just as I say how good Anderson has been, Murray goes 3-1 up in the 3rd. Of course. #USOpen

Murray stays alive! He wins the 3rd set 7-6! #USOpen #tennis
Lets go Andy! Murray wins the 3rd set, down 1-2. #usopen #andymurray
Murray's form has been tremendous this year ... a win tonight would've seen him reach 60 victories in a season for just the 2nd time
There are so many Foo Fighters songs I'd love to see live, but I think February Stars is the one I'd like to see the most

Murray does well to hold. 5-4 to Murray. Anderson to serve to stay in the 3rd set #USOpen
Really great match this now. Anderson is going for broke on every Murray 2nd serve, and Murray is winning most rally points now. #USOpen2015
Holy shit Murray &amp; Anderson have been battling for 4+ hours on Grandstand. Only the 4th set. #USOpen
@tonyredmen1 Hey Tony saw you in the pit at Foo Fighters on Saturday, but didn't have the chance to say hi! Did you have a good evening?

Alright people, you've been waiting for it. Dark Souls. 1 Death = 1 Jalapeno. Tomorrow at 11am PST.  RIP me. https://t.co/9whelmPciD
I like how Thor is bragging about making Esky uncomfortable as if he didn't give up 6 hits and 3 runs in 1st 2 innings.
Chase Fourcade with the 8 yard TD run to give @ArchRUMMEL a 7-0 lead over Curtis with 5 seconds left in 1st quarter.

@Official_NCFC looking better already now Curtis is sat on the bench
@WpgHockTalk true, but I thought the 5 on 5 play was pretty even though well into the 3rd. You didn't? That Mighty Thor goal huge.

The 2nd headline was a story about the guy who plays Thor using his 1st big payday to pay off his parents' debt. *THAT* deserves top honors.

Super-happy for Kendrick today but the reality is he'll lose 90% of those nominations in February and then it's back to hating the Grammys.
Welp I got 3/5 right for AOTY, Kendrick deserves it but it may come down to Taylor or The Weeknd
But ya...I'm just waiting for February so that Cole and Kendrick can drop their collabo album.
I can't stop listening to Black Friday by Kendrick Lamar. Everything about that song is so right! Turned a J. Cole track into one of his own
Watching 'Inside Amy Schumer' for the 1st time. She's funny, sassy, smart, beautiful...&amp; sleeps with a teddy bear in one sketch. I'm hooked.
