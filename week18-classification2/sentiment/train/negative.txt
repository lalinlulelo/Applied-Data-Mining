@Microsoft Heard you are a software company. Why then is most of your software so bad that it has to be replaced by 3rd party apps?
@VofEscaflowne this is the exact reason why I don't preorder Friday releases from Amazon. They always push it back to the Monday delivery.

When David Cameron wanted military action on Syria he may have been supporting IS as he was against Assad

To Erdogan, the prospect of an independent Kurdish state is more frightening than rampaging Islamists. #pkk #ISIS http://t.co/hP1y5n1F33
Wait, people are surprised Erdogan was covertly riding the ISIS tiger? That's just dumb. http://t.co/kFFstMpQj9

Donald Trump may criticize Jeb Bush all he wishes, but he isn't able to call Jeb Bush, nor his supporters, racist like the Donald is.
@RealJamesWoods I hear that Hillary's Authenticity Czar is going on the Sunday shows.
Did anyone see Hillary's Server Boy actually plead the 5th or did his Lawyers only do this in the media? @TGowdySC @greta @zerohedge
Hillary upset Biden may run; Jeb Bush upset Trump is leading in the polls; both had family in the W.H. both feeling entitled to be next
Joe Biden is not going to run for President.  He may even resign as Vice President before term ends.
Probably going to complain another 20 times today about how Justin performs on the today show tomorrow when I start school

GA Tech Game, Falcons Game, Joe Biden in town, Dragon Con, Labor Day Traffic, Rain Traffic..I may just stay the night where im at fuck it.
Smells Like Teen Spirit playing between the top and bottom of the 10th. Probably not what Kurt Cobain had in mind.
Never been a Kerry fan but may they hammer 7 shites into Dublin and wipe the smile off their smug little faces!
Jeb Bush attacking Donald Trump in Spanish seems like the 2nd act of a Greek tragedy where your efforts to avoid the prophecy make it happen
I don't see why justin thinks it's okay to work Tuesday's.. It's fall were supposed to get $1 burgers at bar Louie and blackout
The continued attacks on the 2nd Amendment will continue if America is foolish enough to ever elect Joe Biden for POTUS (Obama's 3rd term).
Sitting here watching Jurassic park: the lost world and remembering why the 1st one is my favorite. #ishouldjustwatchthat
Only going by the latest game stats but think I may have made a mistake backing juventus

@sassygaycallie I'll share 1st. I don't care for c-Lud because of her weird crush on Justin and how sorority girl she comes across. Ur turn!
@StephenGutowski Iran may regret it. But only if it happens under a GOP President after Obama and Kerry are gone.
Triple Traffic Threat: #dragoncon.  Thursday @7:30, Falcons game, Georgia Tech game, and Joe Biden   on the downtown connector.

C'mon Joe Biden. You really don't want to be President. Stop thinking with your ego and start thinking about the party and the people.
@OANN 1/2  I can't believe I'm defending Jeb Bush but here goes... 1st: No official language here in the United States of America.
This is starting to feel like less like a petting zoo &amp; more like Jurassic Park.    ~me at the strip club for lunch on a Wednesday
Joe Biden may not have the "emotional energy" to run for Prez but no problem with the energy level necessary for VP job? #mtp @CNNPolitics
So I've found at least 3 different typos in Jurassic Park since I started reading it. C'mon how long has this book been out?
@morningmika what was the reason U did  not ask questions in the Kerry interview  Sat in silence When U speak it is only to mock the right

Jeb Bush pretending he's a co front runner but he's in 4th place and Carly Fioriana bragging how she's in 2nd place in 2 states. Losers.
ha ha ha... Jeb Bush said he didn't need the base to win and he was going to prove it. But single digit 4th place in NH may be result
As things stand, the bottom 3 in Serie A are Bologna (18th), Empoli (19th); and Juventus (20th).
@mast84 how much more? (to be clear I hate Juventus) but this move doesn't make sense. They may offer 40 million to reach a deal so quickly
@Augustine25 @BillKristol we may elect to forget famous Iran Contra then under Bush till he declared Axis of Evil every one failed Kerry did
Consult a Dr. If you will watch the 2nd half of Swansea vs ManUtd over Roma vs Juventus match @ 7:00
Americans taken hostage by Iran Houthis back in march ..Kerry kept it quiet while Iran deal was being negotiated  so Americans would approve

Jeb Bush releasing tax reform plan tomorrow, Trump will say it is stupid, Bush a moron. His plan: Make America great &amp; put on top again,
Dear journalists, please quit with the Joe Biden stories &amp; speculation. He's not even our 3rd choice. Sincerely, Democrats everywhere.
@RGentle8 No idea sorry! Just kno pundits say Trump will prob. lose popularity later as he has little policy. Poss Jeb Bush may get Rep Nom?
When the *NSYNC account tweets "tomorrow night they're together again," I want the "they're" to be *NSYNC.  Not Justin and Jimmy.
One of the summer's biggest questions: When did we start acting like JURASSIC PARK was an all time classic and not 2nd tier Spielberg?
Jeb Bush may have lots of cash and great political organization but don't compare him to Romney.  He doesn't have the moxie needed today!
Joe Biden for Presient? Really? He may be a nice guy, but the man is a buffoon.

@HolyQueenOfPop @the_mdna_world the poor things are so jaded!  Nobody cares about gags, Madonna is going to shit on her premiere tomorrow!
Sometimes I just feel sorry for messi and cr7 that such immense talents may not add the world cup to their laurels....fuck!!!
@Harry_Styles still upset you didn't tweet about MetLife on Wednesday :(
According to rolling stone, Kurt Cobain is the 12th greatest guitarist of all time... Somebody actually thinks this and it hurts me.
Nirvana was scheduled to headline Lollapalooza in 1994 but dropped out on April 7th. Kurt Cobain's dead body was found the next day.
I went to class with no paper on Monday so I had to write the notes inside my book.. That's why there shouldn't be class on Labor Day
Bullshit! That would then mean you'd piss off Messi. Then have to pay him more too.  https://t.co/MeABTj2Bvx
Well it's August 12th and I've just heard Mariah Carey's 'All I want for Christmas'...seriously?

Alabama State Troopers investigated seven fatal traffic crashes that resulted in nine deaths during the Labor Day holiday from Fri. to Mon.
@musikate @catawu @cmbsweden @verge sorry her shenanigans eclipse any real talent she may have..at least Madonna was strategic w/shenanigans

@Lexus just told by @MotorWorldLexus no loaner car until the 27th great Lexus experience.Definitely not the expectation that was set at sale

@BlueMarchisio @Max_DRealer @PFA he recently said may never be like Messi or cr7
It is almost 2 o'clock in the morning, I have school tomorrow and my roommate is singing Mariah Carey at the top of his lungs in the shower.
The thing about being older is that when I see people like Miley dressing the way she does, all I think is "Meh, Madonna did it 1st."
I'd say I want to be like Kurt Cobain but I can't bear the thought of living till I'm 27. Blow my head off with a shotgun tomorrow.
Still bitter that they didn't tweet about MetLife&amp;now Augustana is opening the show tomorrow night. Just keep giving me reasons to be bitter
Omfg? Magic Mike XXL was on cinemas last July 1st and I didn't even get to see it bummer :--(
