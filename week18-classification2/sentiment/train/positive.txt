Federer will play another final tomorrow. This guy is just amazing. #CincyTennis
Thursday I was at Eric Church, last night I was at OAR, tonight I'm in my pajamas already watching Cars. Rock star life.
@JohnIsner I concur with your coach. Its you! #AmexTennis Good luck tomorrow against Federer!
Let's see how many couples are going to start dry humping when Eric Church sings wrecking ball tomorrow #CountryJam
Eric Church was absolutely amazing last Saturday...he never disappoints http://t.co/unLI6ZvoHT
Federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots.
@Jim_Hulbert Federer faced the highest ranked guy in R1. His draw is tricky. So is Murray's.If Fed reaches the QFs, then he may meet Berdy.
Some outrageous shots from Federer in the tiebreak. The clean half volley return of a Djokovic 2nd serve just about the best of them.
LAST CHANCE!!! I have 2 Eric Church tickets for tomorrow night at the State Fair. PLEASE text or message me if interested!
Wow, tragic start from Federer in the 3rd
Floatin soaking up some sun n some Eric church. Can it get any better than this?
it may look like im going to hard to trap music while driving right now but i assure you i'm listening to fleetwood mac
No doubt my mom will either faint or take her top off when she meets Eric Church tomorrow
I believe #Rafa could win a 3rd #USOpen title if he can make it to the semifinals at least because of Federer, Murray, etc. #usopenworld
Can't wait to see eric church tomorrow with @tcoriell ! #drinkalittledrink #smokealittlesmoke
Federer stays winning. Into the finals tomorrow.
Excited for the Federer vs. Djokovic final in Cincinnati tomorrow afternoon. Should be some great tennis!
@froggy1013 it's good! Drink in my hand- eric church may be about my life though.. #requestingasongviatwitter
Way to go Roger.  Old man Federer just keeps rolling along.  #Djokernole v. #Fed for the final tomorrow.  #CincyTennis
Last year, majority of the Federer matches took place primetime.  This year, it's the other way around.  2nd on Ashe tomorrow
All though Federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter I think Gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen
Federer's second serve placement is awesome. That's why he's the best server ever. Nobody has better placement on 1st or 2nd serve
@mmunro91 I may have never seen a player play a higher tennis level than I just saw, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic included. Make no mistake,
Federer beats Murray 6-4, 7-6(6) to reach #CincyTennis final. He'll be going for his 7th title vs Novak Djokovic, who is going for his first
Laying out in the sun with Eric Church and the lake in the background #perfection #carolina #LaborDay
New @TennisPodcast tomorrow, reviewing Federer, Serena and the pre US Open storylines. This is what we sound like https://t.co/2x0O2UDCe8
Just like in the 2nd, Federer breaks back.
@rosequartz0518 @_claudiaw Beep beep...! Yep, Murray and Federer into the top 16. Phew! :) See you tomorrow!
Gonna have to DVR this Isner and Federer match... This thing is good. Getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. #USOpen2015
@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!
Not going to be able to watch Federer's match vs Darcis but expect to wake up tomorrow to read of a comprehensive victory for the Swiss.
That ending of 2nd set TB by Federer, he really is the original son of Jor-el
Love this new trick that Federer has when he is facing a 2nd serve. Running up to the serve line and taking it early is unreal!
For the 1st time, Federer has beaten No.1 and No.2 players in the ATP Rankings in consecutive matches en route to a title. #CincyTennis
Yes, Federer's attacking return is brilliant.  But yes, it's a play club players can do too, esp. off weak and predictable 2nd serves
You may not know this, but before he was a famous country star . . . Eric Church was a KNIFE salesman.  He talked... http://t.co/TifssYucK8
Federer just won his 15th straight point on his serve... Lol wow
Federer breaks his own record with a 14th appearance at the ATP Finals after reaching the US QF #FinalShowdown http://t.co/ugI3PQBp8w
Monday at the US Open: Murray, Federer &amp; Konta are all in action at Flushing Meadows today http://t.co/50ZM0cOEjT http://t.co/YlLS4kf0of
Fognini is I believe only the 3rd one to beat Nadal 3 or more times in a year - the others (no points for guessing) Federer and Djokovic.
With his consistency in playing great tennis, i am sure Federer will crush Gasquet in the QF. C'mon Federer!! http://t.co/LHCEhZo26g
@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though. But 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against Stan or Murray
Federer is looking good after winning Cincy for the 7th time.
Federer defeats Kohlschreiber 6-3 6-4 6-4 to go through to the 4th Round @usopen
Federer's 1st serve is just...perfect. #USOpen
Federer rebounds from 3-5 down in the 2nd set tb to take it 8-6. Leads Isner. 7-6(0) 7-6(6) #usopen
Friday night cruising through Tennessee, listening to Eric Church with my love #bliss
23rd of August was such a nice day, England lift Ashes, Bolt won 100 m and Federer beats Djokovic in Cincinati.
Federer breaks the Kohlschreiber serve!! Federer is on red hot form &amp; doesnt look like stopping. Fed leads 2-0 in the 1st set #USOpen
What dreams forget, the whisky remembers. Kinda like molasses in late December, justa creepin'. - Eric Church.
Darcis stops the bleeding by winning his 1st game since 1-0 in the first serve. Well, one kind of bleeding because Federer's still leading.
Federer overtakes Lendl for second longest streak of being seeded at the US Open in the Open Era. 15th straight year. Connors leads with 18.
The 1st week of the 2015 #USOpen is almost up &amp; the big names of Serena, Venus, Djokovic, Murray, Federer &amp; Wawrinka are still in the draw.
@tsExtraTime @BenRothenberg Novak is surely the man to beat. Federer or Murray may run him to the base line. The usual suspects.
I believe the loss at RG to Wawrinka was first time in a decade Federer didn't break once in a GS match. This might be the 2nd. #USOpen2015
Federer is about to be done with his match in the same time the 5th set of the Hewitt vs. Tomic match takes!

Federer defeats Darcis 6-1 6-2 6-1 to advance to 3rd Round at the @usopen accomplishing a perfect 16-0 in 2nd Round
You'll love this. @FedfanTejal #BlastFromThePast, Federer, Murray, Serena, Djokovic. Its got it all. #WorthTheRead  https://t.co/4hducxvFiP
Serena punches her ticket to the finals in straight sets. Joins Djokovic and Federer in tomorrow's #CincyTennis singles finals. Decent trio.
Jo Konta's win over Muguruza was the longest ever Women's #USOpen match &amp; the 1st set alone lasted as long as Federer's entire match! Woah!
Good starts for Federer and Stosur. Berdych level at 1-1 after winning the 2nd set!
What a great day for world sport: Usain got his 9th gold, Federer claimed Cincinnati Title no 7 and I pumped some weights. #truepro
Wow, Federer wastes 3 bps with 3 Isner's 2nd serves. Fed 0/8 on bps tonight
@davelackie @heathermarrin we may have had a small Fleetwood Mac style party in your yard but it's okay we invited the neighbors lolol
Ok time to check back in with tennis - Isner and Federer heading into a 2nd tiebreak
Take me back to Friday night to the Eric church concert
I think I may have popped my ear drums and a vain in my head from singing along to Fleetwood Mac very loudly down the parkway #noregrets
Anyone going to the Eric Church concert on Saturday?
Three bands who could have challenged @ledzeppelin : 1st Jeff Beck Group, Free and Fleetwood Mac (with Peter Green).
.@richardgasquet1 honing his game on P3 Court for his match with Federer tomorrow. #USOpen http://t.co/aMKlvtlaqx
Djokovic v Federer should be good one tomorrow. Fancy the Swiss, can't see Djokovic coming back if he falls behind in this one.
"Papa you need a hat" thus said one of Federer's twin girls.......congrats again for winning Cinci for the 7th time @rogerfederer
Add to the results, Federer over Djokovic  and Lewis Hamilton, and it's not a bad Sunday at all!

@amitbhawani @geekyranjit  ...what are your thoughts about Apple's iPod touch 6th gen?
Finally gonna buy my own camera tomorrow ! I'm so excited, I'll be able to take pictures with something else than my old ipod.
Aye now Meek may surprise us. You know when Jay-Z dropped Takeover they thought it was over for Nas. And then Ether......
I knew Jay-z was getting old but I forgot about Eminem. He looks 30 something! https://t.co/fFCMZvL6l9
"We make a million of beats, cause our stories is deep. And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet." - Jay-Z
May the Lord give you Jay-Z and Beyonce's kinda love... No way that relationship is fake or for social media
BTW, @LeeIngram4 is the guy who gave me an iPod last year, on which my son (@PChangerP ) 1st set me up on Twitter. My 1st tweet was 9/6/14.
Found my old iPod from like 7th grade and am now realizing I listened to some hood tunes for just a kid!!

May the best of your today be the worse off your tomorrow  - Jay-Z
I have loads to tell you guys that will make yall super proud but I'm using my iPod now and it's super laggy so I'll tell later or tomorrow
#FF @innocent - not just for the drinks but for Jay-Z's 99 problems! 99 problems that we may just ponder about at some point in our lives!
Dreamed I was @Beyonce and I spent the night making out with Jay-Z at a Lower East Side rooftop party until the sun came up.
@frecklequeen45 I *may* have a playlist on my iPod devoted entirely to songs about trains. I *may* also be a total geek.

@TayToOoCute miss you tay! I was just looking thru my ipod &amp; I have vids of you singing back in SAT prep lol
For those who may not know, Jay-Z wrote the verses for Still D.R.E but he's never disrespected Dre or ever spoken about ghostwriting.
December 4th only cause I used the beginning in my Jay-Z speech for class https://t.co/5bw2R2xGvo
My following may not be as big as Jay-Z's but I got a solid supportive growing following. Thanks for the love. #TeamM00Y0U
@jroberts332 @jobot935 [2/2] That's why my Prog/Indie/Heavy Rock-filled iPod has One Direction's 3rd and 4th albums on it.  I am Not kidding.
If Kanye became President, folk that wrote off the masonic/illuminati symbols in he and Jay-Z's music/vids as meaningless, may think again!
Gonna try to run 6 laps tomorrow atleast 5 it should be easy I just can't talk to ppl. Just gotta listen to my iPod and keep runnin
@normwood I still have my original newfangled iPod. Maybe I'll bring it to the game on Monday.
Meek drooped like a Jay-z album the 2nd &amp; 3rd time you hear it. You will understand it and Fall in love with it
I grew up to this song..didn't knew the 2nd verse is about beyonce..until now.JAY-Z - Lost One ft. Chrisette Michele http://t.co/LYgSbix0Wp
@JKailli Although you may know this better than I do since you're from California lol I'm not knocking Jay-Z view in black culture, I say
"The best part of living in New York is the nightlife. The 2nd best part is knowing that Jay-Z and Beyonce share the same weather as me."
the 1st dance at my wedding will actually just be a duet of Diamonds From Sierra Leone-Remix with my husband as Jay-Z and myself as Kanye.
1 gud thing about losing my phone is that it made me use my iPod which has all the songs I used listen to in 3rd year
CRAZY IN LOVE by BEYONCE FEAT. JAY-Z was no.2 in the UK charts on 2 August 2003 https://t.co/rnU7AFDvUY
